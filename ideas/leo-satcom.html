							<h4>The Rise of Mega Constellations</h4>
							<p>The LEO constellation architecture for space-based telecommunications is not novel– it was originally proposed 30 yrs ago in the early 90s. That initial wave of proposed constellations included a bankruptcy (Iridium), scaled-down plans (Globalstar), and a project cancellation with the return of investor capital (Teledesic). That history left many in the satellite industry justifiably skeptical of the second wave of LEO constellations proposed by SpaceX, OneWeb, Amazon, and others. While the question of business longevity still remains to be demonstrated, there have been several advances in technology that have lowered CAPEX enough to give LEO SATCOM a fair shot on goal.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Macro Trends: Reduced Cost of Launch AND Moore’s Law</p>
							<p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://medium.com/prime-movers-lab/launch-cost-and-cadence-are-key-enablers-for-the-new-space-economy-510bf49c5dbb" target="_blank">the decrease in launch cost and increase in launch cadence</a> [1] and <a href="https://medium.com/prime-movers-lab/bottlenecks-in-rocket-engine-production-may-slow-the-space-economy-flywheel-a51594c510ca" target="_blank">the coming wave of medium-lift reusable launchers from RocketLab, ISRO, China, and France</a> [2].</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-01.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">The cost of launch has dropped one order of magnitude already. Successful operation of Starship will drop it another. Over the next few years, new reusable launch vehicle designs will be coming online from RocketLab, India, China, and France.</p>
							<p>LEO constellations require hundreds to tens of thousands of satellites – the many launches needed to deploy the full constellation are no longer untenably expensive. (Still pricey enough to be spelling billion with a ‘B’. Elon gave an initial cost estimate for Starlink of $10B, later revised to $30B. Telesat estimates $5B for their Lightspeed constellation. Those numbers include satellite manufacturing and launch.) The other macro trend working in LEO SATCOM’s favor is Moore’s Law, which has shrunk both the size and power requirement for the electronics – allowing this generation of communications satellites to be small and lightweight.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-02.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Selected Ongoing and Proposed Commercial Communications Mega-Constellations</p>
							<p>If all the proposed constellations were to come to pass, that would increase the satellites on-orbit by 40x. (As of March 2022 there are ~5000 satellites in orbit). There are industry analysts who have metrics to assess the likelihood of any given constellation coming to fruition, so I won’t re-invent the wheel here. (Curious readers should check out work by Quilty Analytics [17], NSR [18], or space economists like Pierre Lionnet [19] for their heuristics and rankings.) Instead of focus on likelihood, let’s review ongoing results. Starlink has deployed nearly half of the original planned 4408 constellation, OneWeb has deployed 2/3 of their original constellation (but unfortunately lost their ride due to Roscosmos refusing to supply Soyuz launch vehicles during Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine), and Project Kuiper has secured nine of ULA’s Atlas V rockets for their first phase of deployment (likely to start in 2023). Telesat has secured financing for their constellation and selected a supplier. For a detailed analysis of the performance of these four constellations, please see [20].</p>
							<!-- edit -->
							<p>Table does not consider any growth in Internet of Things (IoT) constellations, Earth Observation constellations, weather, positioning/navigation, in-space compute, or in-space manufacturing. For a running list of the hundreds of proposed constellations https://www.newspace.im is a great resource. A natural question seeing this exponential growth in the number of satellites might be, “What’s the upper limit of Earth’s orbital real estate?” A recent op-ed in SpaceNews by MIT researchers provided an order-of-magnitude answer [21]; they share that, “individual shells can fit hundreds of thousands of satellites” and “it is fundamentally feasible for multiple operators to occupy slots in a shared shell.” This serves as today’s reminder that space is big!</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Multi-Orbit Mixed Altitude Architectures</p>
							<p>LEO mega-constellations are not the only way to deliver low latency for customers. Thanks to inter-satellite links, legacy SATCOM companies are working on solutions to leverage their existing assets in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO). For example, SES is currently operating a hybrid MEO – GEO architecture and may one day include LEO [22]. These multi-orbit architectures will see growth in the mobile segment of the SATCOM market [23]. Note, mobile in this instance does not refer to cell phones, but rather to things like airplane wi-fi and maritime connectivity – moving platforms that can fit a receiver terminal.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-03.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Multi-Orbit Mixed Altitude SATCOM Architectures are Enabled by Intersatellite Links (ISLs) [24]</p>
							<p>A comparison of the different SATCOM architectural features can be found in the below table. What’s not shown in the table are power requirements and the number of ground stations. The former is omitted because power is not only a function of distance for a signal to travel, but also the signal frequency. (Higher frequencies need more power to travel the same distance. Higher frequencies also have a higher data throughput. See Appendix for a NASA infographic on frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.) The latter is omitted because inter-satellite links are changing the paradigm for ground stations. The ability to transmit across a constellation should enable a reduced number of ground stations for LEO mega-constellations.</p>

							<h4>Enabling Technologies</h4>
							<p>Bulky dishes and chemical propulsion are passé. Today’s generation of communication satellites are taking advantage of the commercialization of phased array antenna technology, electric propulsion, and inter-satellite links (both radiofrequency and optical).</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Phased Array Antennas</p>
							<p>Phased arrays are yet another example of technology that came out of defense research spending that has become an integral part of our everyday lives. (If you are using WiFi or 5G to read this paper, a phased array is how you’re getting your internet signal.) In 2014 DARPA had a $100M program focused on rapidly developing phased array antenna technologies [27].</p>
							<p>Phased array antennas include multiple emitters in a linear or planar configuration and use the principle of phase-dependent superposition to direct the signal beam without any moving parts. This is called “electronic steering” of the beam, as illustrated on the left-side of the below figure.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-06.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Left: Passive Electronically Steered Array (PESA). Right: Active Electronically Steered Array (AESA). [28]</p>
							<p>The earliest generation of the technology was the passive electronically steered array, which used a single transmitter for all the antenna elements. Each antenna element has a phase shifter that times the signal pulse as required to regulate the composite antenna beam. Second-generation phased array antennas use active electronic steering: there are transmitters for each antenna element, and all of them are computer controlled. This enables AESAs to transmit several radio waves of varying signal frequencies simultaneously in different directions. Texas startup <a href="https://www.cesiumastro.com" target="_blank">CesiumAstro</a> recently completed a $60M Series B financing round for their modular AESA platform [29].</p>
							<p>A phased array antenna enables beamforming by adjusting the phase difference between the driving signal sent to each emitter in the array. This means that beamforming along a specific direction is an interference effect between omnidirectional emitters.</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note on beam forming vs beam steering. Beam forming is using superposition to create the beam. Beam steering is dynamically changing that beam’s direction.</p>
							<p>Digital Beam Forming (DBF) based phased arrays have digital receivers connected to each antenna element. As the signal is digitized at each of the antenna elements by the receivers, antenna beams can be formed digitally in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). DBF can handle multiple input data streams and generate multiple beams simultaneously from one array. This happens on the same frequency channel, optimizing efficient use of spectrum.</p>
							<p>The pros for phased arrays include amplifying the power of the signal, beam forming, electronic beam steering, multi-beams, reduced weight, and improved reliability. The systems are more complex and have a higher burden for signal processing, but they enable much greater flexibility and capability. The improved capabilities and slimmer form factor are why the phased array antenna (sometimes called flat panel antenna) market is projected to have a CAGR of ~41 percent from 2021-2026 [30].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Electric Propulsion</p>
							<p>In-space propulsion has a sizeable design space, as illustrated below, with a half dozen different options available to complete the standard tasks of a satellites’ mission life, such as station keeping, maneuvering to avoid debris, and end-of-life retirement moves (deorbit for LEO or park in graveyard orbit about GEO).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-07.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">In-Space Propulsion Design Trade Space [31]</p>
							<p>Large school bus-sized GEO satellites typically use monopropellant hydrazine thrusters for their propulsion system; hydrazine is easily storable for long durations and doesn’t require an igniter. Simplicity and reliability – things all engineers love in a design. Standard hydrazine thrusters provide a fuel efficiency (Isp) on the order of 200s and thrust that scales with size/pressure, anywhere from order 1 to 100 Newtons of force. The concept of operations for in-space chemical thrusters is generally shorter duration hot-fires to provide a quick impulse. School bus-sized satellites have room for things like propellant tanks, which were larger since GEO satellites typically operate for a 15-year mission life.</p>
							<p>LEO satellites have different mission needs and so have been leveraging the advances in electric propulsion for their designs. Depending on the orbital altitude selected, LEO satellites can have a mission as short as five years – naturally deorbiting due to orbital decay from atmospheric drag. Most LEO constellation operators put an upper limit on their satellite life of 10 years (the current guideline for orbital debris mitigation is to deorbit satellites before 25 years). The shorter mission life is selected for LEO because it’s more advantageous to constantly refresh the constellation with the latest technology. <b>LEO mega-constellations are driving an industry trend of satellite disposability.</b></p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: thousands of satellites burning up in the atmosphere has the unintentional side-effect of being a geoengineering experiment to slow climate change. One way to mitigate solar radiation is via dispersal of aluminum particles.</p>
							<p>Shorter mission life coupled with a desire for smaller satellites led the cubesat community towards electric propulsion. As mentioned previously, the evolving design paradigm for LEO SATCOM is slim profile. This helps with the volumetric efficiency of the payload during launch, as well as reducing the cross-sectional area in the direction of the velocity vector (which reduces drag and, therefore, the amount of station-keeping needed). Electric propulsion thrusters are exceptionally fuel efficient, with Isp ~ 1,000s, so the amount of fuel (typically a noble gas) needed is tiny. Electric propulsion is an enabling technology for the slim design paradigm. The downside of electric propulsion is the thrust is tiny, measured in microNewtons. Electric thrusters will fire for long durations, periodically turning off to deal with thermal heat soak, and can take many months to get a satellite to its final orbit.</p>
							<p>Due to the low thrust of electric propulsors, the thrusters begin firing days before predicted conjunction for satellites to maneuver out of the way of orbital debris. <a href="https://orbionspace.com" target="_blank">Orbion Space Technology</a> was recently awarded a Phase II SBIR from AFWERX to develop a solution for little-to-no-warning debris collision avoidance maneuvers, blending their Hall thruster with an emergency store of cold gas to increase the thrust [32].</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-08.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">NASA’s SEP Hall Thruster [33]</p>
							<!-- edit -->
							<p>For brevity sake I won’t cover technical details on the half dozen different types of electric thrusters. For those who are curious about the most ubiquitous form factor, the Hall Thruster, check out this IEEE Spectrum piece for history on the inventor and explanation of the invention [34].</p>
							<p>Some notable deals in the electric propulsion space happened in July of 2021 – Astra acquired Apollo Fusion for $75M [35], and Accion Systems raised a $42M Series C round on an $83M post-money valuation [36]. The global space propulsion market is projected to have a CAGR of ~16 percent from 2020-2025 [37].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Inter-satellite Links</p>
							<p>Enabling satellites to communicate directly with one another and to pass on information is the other major enabling technology for the success of LEO SATCOM. The industry has been primarily focused on developing and demonstrating optical-inter-satellite links (OISL) due to the very high (10x or more) data rates compared to RF. OISLs use a narrow beam of light to communicate and require a direct line of sight to minimize interference. This makes OISLs robust against jamming and eavesdropping (a bad actor would have to intercept along the line of sight path directly).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-09.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Optical Intersatellite Links – space is the ideal environment for laser-based communications [38]</p>
							<!-- editing -->
							<p>The DOD and NASA have programs testing inter-satellite links, such as DARPA’s BlackJack program [39] and NASA’s Laser Communications Data Relay program [40] . There have been setbacks, such as General Atomics recent failure to demo their OISL hardware for the Space Development Agency (SDA) [41]. The SDA utilizes a more modern ‘portfolio approach’ to capabilities development, which means they have another shot-on-goal via an award to optical communications startups <a href="http://bridgecomminc.com" target="_blank">BridgeComm</a> and <a href="https://www.spacemicro.com" target="_blank">Space Micro</a>, who are developing an optical one-to-many links that can do point-to-multipoint transmission [42]. The commercial satellite industry’s need for optical inter-satellite links accelerated the development and adoption timelines. Several commercial OISL providers have successfully demonstrated their technology, including <a href="https://www.tesat.de" target="_blank">Tesat-Spacecom</a> [43] and <a href="https://mynaric.com" target="_blank">Mynaric</a> [44].</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: optical downlinks and optical ground stations are another possibility, but cloud cover and correcting for atmospheric turbulence has put a damper on commercial operators adding the size, weight and power to the satellite to also carry an optical downlink (thus RF remains the popular choice for downlink). Two exceptions for optical downlink. (1) Deep space communications would benefit from optical (to minimize propagation losses) and will likely locate ground stations in fair weather regions. (2) the DOD wants resilient architectures [45] and optical downlink has unique strengths from a cybersecurity perspective.</p>

							<h4>Ground Equipment</h4>
							<p>The big news in ground equipment has been the ability to demonstrate communications with satellites in different orbits. <a href="https://www.isotropicsystems.com" target="_blank">Isotropic Systems</a> recently completed an additional demonstration of this capability for the U.S. Army [46], after having done its own tests in collaboration with SES last November. One take-away from interviews I’ve conducted with officials in the SDA and Space Force is that the DOD is overrun with terminals for the various satellite systems. Whoever figures out how to make “one terminal to rule them all” will have more gold than Smaug.</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: the <a href="https://dificonsortium.org" target="_blank">DIFI Consortium</a> is working to create open “RF over IP” like standards for interoperable satellite communications. [47]</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.kymetacorp.com" target="_blank">Kymeta</a> is another company working on multi-orbit terminals. Prime Movers Lab Technical Partner Alessandro Levi did a fantastic job explaining their technology in his whitepaper on Metamaterials [48], so I’d rather direct curious readers there. (Kymeta also has a whitepaper on their website for even more technical readers [49].) Kymeta is working on a stationary user terminal for OneWeb’s network, to be released this summer [50]. In February Kymeta entered into a strategic partnership with Kratos to develop a mobile antenna and software-defined terminal solution [51].</p>

							<h4>Commercial Satellite Market</h4>
							<p>The satellite industry clocks in at $271B as of 2020 [52]. The SATCOM portion of that market is currently ~$22B (minus the part of the telecommunications market that is focused on television and radio).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-10.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Satellite Industry Association (SIA) and BryceTech 2021 report “State of the Satellite Industry” [52]</p>
							<p>For context, terrestrial telecommunications is a trillion-dollar industry. People are pursuing LEO SATCOM not because of the current market size but because of the future projections (e.g. Morgan Stanley predicts satellite internet will grow to ~40 percent of the space economy, $412B, by 2040 [53]). There have been several space industry market reports done by investment banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America that size the 2040 space economy at over $1T. To be thorough, I’d like to share two more conservative analyses of the space industry so that informed readers can decide for themselves. First, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released an analysis in January 2022 that reviewed data for the space industry from 2012-2019 [54]. Second, Bhavya Lal, current Associate Administrator for Technology, Policy, and Strategy at NASA, led a study in 2019 while at the IDA Science & Technology Policy Institute to “Measure the Space Economy” [55].</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-11.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Left: U.S. space economy gross output by industry group [54], Right: Estimates of size & composition of space economy [55]</p>
							<p>Of note, the SIA report is for the global space economy, while the two other charts are specific to the United States. (The SIA report does provide one example breakdown by region, for the $12.2B satellite manufacturing category. The U.S. portion of that market is $7.9B.) It’s also worth noting that the SIA estimate is considered a high-quality data source! And yet there are substantial differences in estimates for the size of today’s space economy. This was shared to put into context the future projections for the space economy generated via investment bank research.</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: I’m still new to the lingo of finance, but I think the label ‘exuberant’ could be applied to some of the projections shown below.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/leo-satcom/x-12.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Comparisons by category of 2016 estimates and 2040 projections of the size of the space economy [55]</p>
							<p>For one final perspective that’s neither government, nor space consultant, nor banker, McKinsey published a report on LEO mega-constellations [56] that models a “disruptive scenario” where costs drop enough to spur high demand.

							<p class="small-caption">Change in flow properties across a normal shock</p>
							<p>Flow physics in the supersonic flight regime are reasonably well modeled in one-dimension (1-D) via the normal shock relations. While the shock wave itself is an irreversible process, on either side of the shock the simplifying assumptions of isentropic flow (ideal gas, adiabatic, inviscid, irrotational flow) can be applied to get a closed-form solution. Rather than show equations, it’s helpful to view the normal shock relations plotted, to see how much each quantity changes with an increasing freestream Mach number.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/high-speed-flight/x-03.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">The normal shock relations for air [1]</p>
							<p>You might ask, what’s the point of a 1-D model? Aircraft are 3-D! Aerodynamicists, in addition to loving non-dimensional numbers, also love scaling laws. They provide a framework for thinking about the largest first-order effects of the flow physics. In the diagram above, the biggest takeaway is that <b>pressure scales with velocity squared</b>.</p>
							<p>The practical design implication for aircraft is that the faster you go, the larger the pressure loads and the more thrust you’ll need to overcome the resultant induced drag force. Pressure scales linearly with freestream density and linearly with the cross-sectional area of the aircraft, so aircraft designers have af to ~1,400K at Mach 5, to ~12,000 K at Mach 15. As illustrated in the computational image below, hypersonic flow is non-ideal, with energy dissipation pathways that reduce the near-wall gas temperature closer to ~6,000 K. (The hypersonic flight environment is dominated by tremendous heat loads. This is still hotter than any existing material melting point. Materials will be covered in more detail later.)</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Computational Fluid Dynamics models illustrate thermochemical non-equilibrium of hypersonic flow. The blunt nose shape on the left pushes the highest temperature region away from the surface. [2]</p>
							<p>As speed increases above Mach 5, the collisions of the gas molecules are no longer elastic (like balls on a pool table bouncing off each other), meaning that the idealh numbers (M>10) and altitudes (>60km). This phenomenology creates the plasma responsible for the communications black-out zone during re-entry. The graph below illustrates the regimes for different hypersonic flow physics and flight trajectories for known vehicles.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Hypersonic Flow Physics Phenomenology: (a) Turbulence Regime and (b) Thermochemistry [3]</p>
							<p>These changes to the flow physics, known as thermochemical nonequilibrium flow, are a challenge to model accurately. Rather than write out the Navier-Stokes equations here, it’s faster to discuss their mathematical properties. The Navier-Stokes equations are mixed-type partial differential equations (PDEs). This means that the solutions are weak (non-unique) and dependent on the local flow properties. In the stagnation region of a hypersonic flow, they behave as elliptical PDEs, while beyond the Mach line they behave as hyperbolic PDEs. Getting a converged solution representative of reality is hard. That’s why <b>test data and simplified approximations (aka hand-calcs) are so important — they anchor us to reality</b>.</p>
							<p>A key point to appreciate about the majority of our modern hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers is that they all use a similar numerical approach to se of epistemic uncertainty head-on, researchers are computing reaction coefficients from first principles statistical atomic collisions [5] and collecting new shock tube data.) The charts below illustrate the <b>disconnect between ground test data we can acquire and the regimes where we actually fly</b>.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">There’s not a ground-based wind tunnel on Earth that can replicate the conditions experienced in air during hypersonic flight. That’s part of what has slowed progress in this field – flight test is essential (and expensive)! [3]</p>
							<p>CFD practitioners create high-quality converged solutions by paying careful attention to the flow-field discretization (aka grid quality and timestep), boundary conditions, initial conditions, and selection of turbulence models appropriate for the flow regime.

							<h4>Aerothermodynamic Design</h4>
							<p>In aerodynamic design, the function determines the form. In other words, aircraft look the way they do as a result of the flow physics they are required to fly through. Subsonic aircraft have soft rounded shapes with smooth continuous gradients in radius of curvature — the design intent is to keep the flow smooth and attached for as long as possible to reduce drag.</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: I’ve not yet mentioned the transonic flow regime. Today’s commercial passenger jets tend to cruise at M~0.85, which means their wings encounter transonic flow phenomena during flight: there are local shockwaves on the upper surface of the wing (the suction side of the airfoil) that cause the flow to detach early and create a much higher drag coefficien [6] and the F-14’s variable swept wings [7]. Of note, while the SR-71’s engine had lineaign, what makes hypersonics hard is trying to survive the environment resultant from the <b>heat flux scaling with velocity cubed</b>.</p>

							<p>Recap: subsonic vehicles have rounded edges and supersonic ones have sharp leading edges. Hypersonic vehicles go back to rounded (aka blunt) shapes. <b>When designing a hypersonic vehicle, the top engineering priority shifts from reducing drag to surviving the heat loads.</b> Blunt body theory was developed to push the shock wave off from the vehicle, as conventional materials cannot withstand the post-shock environment.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Aerospace materials, example use, and properties</p>
							<p>Key takeaways from this table:</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li>Aerospace engineers love titanium because it’s light and strong, but its melting point is low.</li>
								<li>Tungsten has a much higher melting point, but it’s very heavy and somewhat brittle.</li>
								<li>Lots of ongoing research into using Silicon Carbide, among other types of Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs), as a next-gen material for leading edges and as a coating layer on other parts of the vehicle. The problem with ceramics is their low fracture toughness and lack of tensile strength. (Impact resistance is a problem for all-ceramic thermal protection solutions, with the most tragic example being the loss of Shuttle Columbia.)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are three types of thermal protection systems (TPS): passive, ablative, and active. Passive thermal systems are reusable; they rely on radiative heat rejectionl tf 3x to ensure survivability of the vehicle in a worst-case scenario. These large TPS margins eat into the weight available to carry passengers and cargo. <b>Hypersonic vehicle designers deal with the large uncertainties on predicted heat loads by allocating a substantial amount of their weight budget to thermal protection systems.</b></p>

In their wonderful book Coming Home: Reentry and Recovery from Spdt. The design reference trajectory and method of propulsion were both feasible back then (and variations of this solution architecture are used in military hypersonic systems today).

							<p>There exists somewhat of a debate as to the identity of the first vehicle to achieve hypersonic speeds. As aerospace legend John Anderson notes for The Smithsonian [13], the first object to travel hypersonic (over 5 times faster than the speed of sounydrogen has a much higher flame speed thus is easier to light in a supersonic combustion environment and (2) hydrogen is more energetic. <b>The X-51A achieving sustained net-positive thrust with a hydrocarbon scramjet was the hypersonic equivalent of the Wright Brothers’ Flight.</b></p>

							<p>Observant readers will note a ~40-year gap between the X-15 and the X-43 programs for successfully demonstrated hypersonics milestones. Hypersonics development in the U.S. was cyclical for decades. Beyond the lack of an external impetus to develop hypersonic capabilities, another reason that U.S. funding for hypersonics crements are ill-defined and continually changing. This alone drives one reason to remain optimistic about non-traditional commercial hypersonic companies: they are setting their own requirements for the product, rather than the inefficient and painful iterative process with government program managers that happens today.</p>

The desire for a supersonic commercial jet became a national prestige project for the Americans, the Russians, and the British and the French (who partnered together via ependent from all other countries, focusing his efforts on nuclear power and aerospace. Both books agree on the impetus for the American SST program being national prestige, but differ on whether JFK would spend whatever it took to win.</p>
							<p>The two books also offer contrasting opinions of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who was ultimately responsible for ending the American SST program. Either McNamara was hell-bent on killing the XB-70 and the American SST because of a back-of-the-envelope calculation he did, or he was an early student of systems engineering who wanted the program closely studied to verify or refute his hand calc.</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: McNamara is famous for implementing the current Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process for defensive acquisitions. There is a strong reform movement going on today, because that process uses central planning and has left the U.S. DOD at a disadvantage to our more agile adversaries. [21])</p>

Boom, a Prime Movers Growth portfolio company, has a commanding lead in this market segment, as evidenced by the 65-seat to 88-seat Overture’s design maturity and their recent order with United to enter into service in 2029 [45]. Boom has also made tangible technical progress, reducing risk through its XB-1 demonstrator airplane, scheduled to fly in 2022.</p>

Exosonic graduated from Y Combinator in March 2020 with $150K of funding and was awarded a $450K STTR grant to collaborate with Stanford on transitioning their design for a military cargo application [46]. Whether Exosonic can leverage their initial work into a larger program, as both Boom and hypersonic startup Hermeus recently did with their $30M STRATFI DOD  I’d like to highlight from those reports illustrate the time savings by speed class and the customer demand signal for the value of that saved time from surveyed high net-worth individuals.</p>
