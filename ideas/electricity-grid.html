							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>The National Academy of Engineering named electrification as the most important achievement of the 20th century for its impacts on quality of life in the developed world. [1]</p>
							<p class="callout">The impact of electrification will only grow in the 21st century because <b>the grid is the backbone of a clean energy future.</b></p>
							<p>Electrification and carbon-free energy generation require a stronger electricity grid — one that can move more power over longer distances while also supporting new loads like electric vehicle charging and energy-intensive industrial processes, and providing reliable service through more extreme and variable weather conditions.</p>
							<p>Decarbonization models suggest that the US transmission system will need to double in capacity or more [2] [3] — not necessarily twice as many lines, but twice as much capability of carrying power over distance. More high-power lines would mean fewer miles added, and existing electrical lines can be upgraded to get many more times the power through the same or similar land footprint.</p>
							<p>The existing grid system has been built around one-way flow — from power generation to load. It needs widespread deployment of sensing and control systems for managing two-way flow — where power could come from a rooftop solar power or home battery system just as easily as from utility scale power plants.</p>
							<p>At Prime Movers Lab, we have a deep interest in addressing the global challenge of climate change. The grid is at the intersection of two of our verticals – energy and infrastructure. We recognize that transforming the electricity grid is a linchpin for clean, abundant energy access. To understand what the grid needs and where the solutions are, we have spent time speaking with numerous companies developing grid hardware technologies and software services as well as investment and policy experts. What follows is a summary of what we have learned, primarily focused on the US electricity grid but with insights that are applicable globally.</p>

							<h4>Understanding the Grid [4]</h4>
							<p class="subheading">What Is the Grid?</p>
							<p>The electricity grid spans from the power electronics systems that connect generation sources to electric wires, through high voltage transmission lines, electric substations and converter stations, to the distribution lines that run through cities and towns and into the breakbox in a home or business. From a technology perspective, it’s easiest to think about in 3 buckets:</p>
							<p>The <b>Transmission System</b> is the wires that traditionally connect large power plants to distribution substations. Hundreds of thousands of miles of interconnected high voltage transmission lines (>100 kV) primarily bring power from a plant towards a population center. [] They move power over distance for bulk power purchase.</p>
							<p>The <b>Distribution System</b> is the wires, sensors and substations that traditionally bring power to homes and businesses. There are more than a million miles of distribution lines in the US. [] This flow of power has been primarily one way, from the system into the home, but that is changing with distributed energy resources.</p>
							<p>The <b>Grid Edge</b> is at either end of the system, the technology that integrates power generation sources or integrates loads. This includes inverters that convert, for example, rooftop solar or EVs to grid compliant power, smart meters that measure consumption, and smart circuit breakers or other management systems that may have control of the systems and appliances behind the meter. With the growth of rooftop solar, battery walls, and electric vehicles, these previously distinct edges are blurring into each other. The challenges at the grid edge are power sensing and control. Managing a lot of small resources is functionally different than managing a few large resources. The data needs, response time, and number of interactions is much higher with many small resources. The way large resources interact with the system is also different than how small resources interact. This is a fast growing area for hardware and software solutions. Grid edge includes vehicle-to-grid and building-to-grid solutions.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/electricity-grid/x-01.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Conceptual drawing of the electricity grid. For the purposes of this landscape analysis, the grid is divided into 3 buckets: transmission, distribution, and grid edge. Power generation and end use are considered outside the grid.</p>
							<p>For the most part, tech still falls into one of these buckets. Virtual power plants, largely a conceptual idea in most parts of the US due to lack of incentives, would further blur the edges, as conceivably they could aggregate resources at the distribution scale and participate in the transmission scale power markets, remunerating individuals for allowing their vehicle, storage, or generation assets to be managed and used by the grid. Broadly, it is a collection of energy assets that are managed together to respond to grid signals and are compensated according to providing that service. In the later landscape analysis, VPPs are categorized as grid edge to specify that the owner and manager of the tech described is not the distribution utility, but this is not a required differentiation.</p>
							<p class="subheading">The Grid Is THE Bottleneck for Decarbonization [7]</p>
							<p>The electricity grid is the bottleneck for decarbonization, particularly in countries like the US with a highly developed grid infrastructure. Every decarbonization study finds that the US needs to dramatically expand the transmission system to decarbonize by 2050, even after accounting for local resources. [8] [9] [10] [11] It’s simple economies of scale. Rooftop and community solar, and home and EV batteries, can only go so far, especially any place other than the southwest, and those investments must be made everywhere. Electricity transmission allows a single investment to aggregate and provide power to multiple regions. In 2020, MIT looked at decarbonization pathways at various scales, and found that more regionalization led to less expensive overall systems and more system benefits. [12]</p>
							<p>This expansion is needed to accommodate new loads and new sources of generation. EV adoption is the most salient in the news and short term driver of grid technology changes, but electrification of home heating and decarbonization of industrial loads will also drive more demand. [13] At the same time, clean energy sources are in different locations than existing fossil fuel infrastructure. These new generation sources need transmission to connect them, and their variability compared to fossil fuel generation means the transmission system must aggregate, move, and smooth electricity flow more effectively in the coming decades.</p>
							<p class="callout">It’s not just a grid capacity increase, it’s a capability increase that’s required.</p>
							<p>This is not to discount the need for investment in local solutions, especially technology solutions. In the 2022 summer heat wave, Southern California imported a lot of energy, but it also asked its residents to reduce their consumption, something called “demand response.” [14] Demand response could be so much more than simply manually reducing consumption, though. In extreme cases, where the power demands could not be met, rolling blackouts could be replaced, or at least tempered, by selective energy management — utilities turning off water heaters or adjusting thermostat settings and EVs providing power back to the grid are just the tip of the iceberg for what a democratized system could provide — with the right technology in place.</p>
							<p class="callout">Decarbonizing the US grid will require a $3-5 trillion investment in power infrastructure. [15]</p>
							<p>The traditional business model of this expenditure is captured by regulated monopolies, but the democratization of energy, through local and personal ownership of energy assets, is changing how the grid functions and may change business models and expand the possibilities for market entry.</p>
							<p>This landscape is largely focused on the US case, which has a lot of overlap with Europe from a technical challenge perspective but different regulatory structures. Electrification is creating grid technology opportunities globally, too, of course. Developing grids face similar challenges as the US, but with both more flexibility to build smart-from-the-start solutions, and less reliable infrastructure as a backbone off which to develop and deploy.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Regulatory Barriers to Transforming the Grid</p>
							<p>Though the grid is sometimes compared to the highway system, building it out and managing it is far more complex. A traffic jam in NYC does not cause a traffic jam in Nashville, but the interconnected grid can have such far-reaching consequences without sufficient management. And electricity must be used as it is generated — the electrons can’t show up 30 minutes late because of a detour. Adding more storage to the grid will help this last aspect of course, but the operations challenge still remains. Storage is just another component that must be managed to ensure the electrons are all still accounted for.</p>
							<p>This complexity makes most utilities risk-averse. In most cases utilities are operated as regulated monopolies – they are allowed to make business and infrastructure decisions without fear of competitors, but must make their case to regulators to recover their costs from rate payers. The regulated monopoly structure does not incentivize innovation or maximization of infrastructure use. It also makes it difficult to build high power lines to move power across states. [16]</p>
							<p class="callout">There are approximately 3,000 distribution utilities in the US, with various ownership and regulatory structures. [17]</p>
							<p>Of those, 150 are investor owned utilities that serve 70% of the population and 50% of the land mass. That leaves 2800 utilities that serve everyone else, including public power providers and rural electric co-ops. This is a highly fractured market with powerful incumbent providers (both the utilities and the corporations that provide their hardware and software management solutions. The transmission system is also fractured and captured, though there are overall fewer players in the space. [18] Together, these factors make adoption and scale of solutions difficult.</p>
							<p>At the transmission scale, much of the tech needed exists but implementation is stymied by the policy barriers. Utilities manage their own costs and footprints, and state regulators review those expenditures with state goals and outcomes in mind. This is a major barrier for transmission technology that can increase efficiency (as it does not provide higher returns for investors in many cases) and transmission systems that cross boundaries (as they disrupt existing business models, including the economics of existing power plants). There is very limited federal authority to support interstate electricity commerce, even though studies show this is better overall for consumers in terms of cost and resilience. [19]</p> 
							<p>At the grid edge (e.g. the residential meter), there are hardware and software tech solutions that need to be proved out and then deployed at scale to change the way electricity is used. This area has seen the most innovation lately because it is experiencing the most technology changes: smart thermostats, electrified heating, and electronic vehicles are changing how (and how much!) consumers think about electricity. There are still data access and integration issues that must be tackled to reach the full potential of distributed resources, though.</p>

							<h4>An Electricity Primer [20]</h4>
							<p>Electric power (P), measured in Watts is the product of voltage (V), measured in Volts and current (I, so abbreviated because it used to be called intensity), measured in amperes (amps).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/electricity-grid/x-02.webp">
							<p>Transmission of power faces resistance in the wires (R), measured in ohms. Power is lost due to resistance and current:</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/electricity-grid/x-03.webp">
							<p>Increasing either power component, voltage or current, results in more power, but only current contributes to electrical losses. Thus, a high voltage, low current system is more efficient than a low voltage, high current system. Resistance of wires increases with distance, so this tradeoff is especially important for longer distance lines.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Alternating Current</p>
							<p>Alternating current is so named because the current follows a sinusoidal pattern, alternating between positive and negative. In the US, Canada, and most of Central and South America this wave alternates with a frequency of 60 Hz (60 times per second). In Europe, Australia, and most of Asia and Africa the grid alternates at 50 Hz. [21]</p>
							<p>Japan famously has a grid that is half 50 Hz, half 60 Hz because the UK and the US each rebuilt one side of the island, using their standard equipment. At the seam of these systems are DC stations to allow power transfer to happen. Differences in frequency are just one example of how grid solutions are complicated and not universal. [22]</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/electricity-grid/x-04.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">AC voltage versus DC voltage</p>
							<p>This variable pattern allows AC systems to leverage fundamental electrical and magnetic properties of some metals to transform power from low voltage to high voltage and vice versa.</p>
							<p class="callout">AC systems can easily increase voltage to move power efficiently.</p>
							<p>The traditional transformer consists of two sets of wire windings around a core.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/electricity-grid/x-05.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">AC transformers are the key to AC efficiency in transmission of electric power. Imaged adapted from ElProCus [23]</p>
							<p>The ratio of the windings determines how the voltage is transformed. If the input has 4 times the coils as the output (4:1), then the output voltage will be ¼ the input voltage, For example, 480- kV would step-down to 120 kV. The same is true in reverse. To get a higher voltage, the input power should have fewer coils than the output power. Reversing the above, a 1:4 ration would step the voltage up from 120 kV to 480 kV. This is the key to AC’s advantage in electricity transmission.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Direct Current</p>
							<p>A DC system, in contrast, maintains a constant (or direct) flow, and cannot tap into those electro-magnetic properties.</p>
							<p>The easiest way to change the voltage of a DC system is to convert it to AC, increase the AC voltage, and convert back to DC! This is why we have an AC dominant systems across the globe – when Edison and Westinghouse battled it out in the 1890s, Westinghouse’s AC system was far more efficient. [24]</p>
							<p>AC continued to dominate the electricity system throughout the 1900s because it was inexpensive, and HVDC conversion technology was cumbersome to operate. 100 years ago the only way to convert from AC to DC was by using an inefficient motor. The only high voltage DC (HVDC) in the US grid (less than 1% of US transmission miles [25]) was built for applications where AC was not suitable. It is difficult for AC systems to maintain stability over long distances, so HVDC systems were built to move hydropower that was remotely located to population centers. The electromagnetic properties that make AC systems highly efficient work best above ground. Underground or undersea AC lines create interference resulting in inefficient lines, so DC systems are also used for many underwater transmission needs such as crossing the Long Island Sound or routing through the San Francisco Bay. It is also an attractive option for the growing offshore wind industry.</p>
							<p class="callout">The desire for long distance and underground lines is growing, and recent advances in technology provide additional benefits, making the case for more HVDC.</p>
							<p>The first grid integration of AC and DC was in the 1940s, using mercury arc valves to convert DC power from a dam. In the 1970s, thyristors (the first semiconductor based solutions) were used and are now the dominant technology for DC in the grid. In the late 1990s, ABB demonstrated a new technology based on transistor, called voltage source conversion, that, while not yet dominant in the grid from a use perspective, is certainly dominant in project proposals, due to its ease of integration with the AC system, applicability for off-shore wind, and ability to accommodate multiple terminals (the DC version of power substations that provide power to towns along the path).

							<h4>List of Key Minerals & Sourcing</h4>
							<p>A global clean energy transition will likely encompass wide-ranging technologies from solar PV and wind electricity production to EVs, battery storage and future hydrogen psely on the same five key minerals or mineral categories which will likely direct rollout. Supply bottlenecks and environmental impacts of production will likely play a key role in the cost and adoption of differing energy solutions.</p>
							<p class="callout">These core five minerals needed for clean energy technologies are: <b>Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, and Rare-Earth Elements (REEs)</b>.</p>
							<p>Each of these critical minerals are sourced in a different fashion with geopolitics influencing current global sourcing, but can largely be broken down into the countriessvelopment project takes anywhere from 4 to 16 years to just open an ore deposit fxican brine ponds in Argentina and Chile, and mined spodumene in Australia, corresponding to 39% and 49% of global production in 2020 respectively. Further analysis of price fluctuations and global reserves is detailed effectively in a recent <a href="https://medium.com/prime-movers-lab/does-the-u-s-have-enough-lithium-to-support-the-growing-ev-market-d73a44a969e5" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Despite these two regions’ dominant production of raw materials, processing occurs largely elsewherexldwide could result in a severe bottleneck in deployment of EV and energy storage technologies, which rely heavily on this mineral.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Electric vehicles at solar charging station. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car" target="_blank">Image Source</a></p>
							<p>Similarly, while Li is critical as an energy transfer mechanism in current battery designs, a key driver in increased energy density in Li ion batteries is ths to promote domestic smelting and processing into refined higher-value nickel products. Additionally, the production of 1 kg of Ni metal is linked to over 13 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [7] with severe environmental effects on local communities due to water pollution from mine tailings and air pollution from processing nickel sulfide deposits. Severe price fluctuations of Ni and Co could affect battery chemistries in future EVs as viable high-nickel and high-cobalt designs have been effectively deployed already in NCA and NMC batteries, and raw material cost will be a key factor in their competitive adoption across the industry.</p>

							<p>While Li may be great at storing energy, <b>Copper (Cu)</b> is a fantastic means of transferring it, or electrons to be exact, through grid electricity transfer and xssing plants to ensure stable domestic production of this critical group of minerals, with MP Materials in Las Vegas investing over $700 million to develop a rare earths magnetics production plant <a href="https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-begins-construction-on-texas-rare-earth-magnetics-factory-to-restore-full-us-supply-chain" target="_blank">set to open in late 2023</a>. Furthermore, current processing techniques for neodymium oxide (a powerful permanent magnet REE) emits more than 62 metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent to produce one ton of REE, severely undercutting greenhouse gas emissions offset by the clean energy technologies deployxestic supply chains. Both of these trends threaten China’s mineral processing dominance in the near future, more closely examined in this <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LTRC_ChinaSupplyChain.pdf" target="_blank">report by the Brookings Institution.</a> [8]</p>
							<p>Meeting the expected increase in demand while dramatically changing established mineral supply chains will require retooling our established systems of production and introducing new technologies to enable strong and sustainable sources of energy minerals for our energy future.</p>

							<p>Given the recent geopolitical upheaval seen in oil and gas markets by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, domestic production and processing of these critical minerals has come to the forefront as a priority for both economic and national security. The International Energy Agency in a recent <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions" target="_blank">report</a> highlighted 3 key mechanisms to meet a potential gap in the minerals market: Diversify Sources, Promote Tech Innovation, and Scale-up Recycling.</p>
							<p>First, to begin to address these security issues the U.S. Department of Energy has recently announced xicxe is located, is in the process of reopening the Blackbird site, aiming to meet sustainable production in early 2023. This mined cobalt would be shipped to its Ni and Co refinery in Brazil and is expected to produce <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/cobalt-clean-energy-climate-change-idaho/621321" target="_blank">2,000 tons of cobalt a year, meeting around 10% of expected United States demand</a>.</p>
							<p>Promoting technical innovation for efficient use of existing mineral streams and enabling access to new supplies is also critical to securing domestic supply chains. Several nxle metalxerials and Li-Cycle alone and with $480 million approved by DOE for Ascend Elements to establish a manufacturing facility in Kentucky for materials separation, processing, and component manufacturing.</p>

							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<p>To enable a global clean energy transition, the deployments of wide-ranging energy production and storage technologies require a stable and secure supply of critical minx0, with existing operations nearing their production limits due to declining ore quality and rising extraction costs. Geopolitical risk (with over 70% of the world’s cobalt production in the DRC and over 90% of REE processing in China) and high CO<sub>2</sub> process emissions (up to 62 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per one kg of neodymium produced) demand new technologies that are capable of extracting mineral resources from domestic sources, at highx access of previously underutilized resources like mine tailings ponds to meet the critical mineral requirements of tomorrow. We expect to see further innovation in the years ahead as demand pressures increase.</p>
