							<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
							<p>Quantum computing is a technology that could transform billions of lives by enabling humans to solve previously intractable problems in optimization, chemistry, advanced materials, and other areas. However, it still has a long way to go to realize these promises.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/quantum-computing/x-01.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Figure 1. Quantum computing promises to solve previously impossible problems in fields like optimization.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Macro Trends: Reduced Cost of Launch AND Moore’s Law</p>
							<p>Key takeaways on quantum computing companies in general:</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li>The number of quantum computer companies is small compared to other sectors we have evaluated, like alternative proteins, batteries, or satellites. Many of the groups listed are university or government labs, or departments within larger tech companies (Google, IBM, Amazon)</li>
								<li>Superconducting qubit-based approaches are the most researched (and have received the most development resources)</li>
								<li>Almost all of the startups in this space are based on technology from university labs</li>
								<li>Due to the intense specialization required and limited talent pool for quantum technology development, the competition for talent in the quantum computing space is fierce</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Quantum Computing is a relatively new field of interest for investors. A wave of startups was founded around 2017-2018. Three years later, the total dollar amount invested has increased from less than $500 million to roughly $3 billion as companies like DWave, PSIQuantum, and Xanadu have raised large, later-stage rounds. Investor activity before 2021 was almost entirely venture capital. The first significant exit in this space was quantum encryption company ArQit (NAS: ARQQ) which went public via SPAC for $1B in 2021. Then, IonQ (which is developing quantum computers using trapped ions as qubits) followed, going public via SPAC at a $2B valuation. ). In October 2021, Rigetti (superconducting qubits) announced the approval of its SPAC at a $1.5B valuation.</p>
							<p>Why invest in quantum computing? There is clearly a momentum play here - several companies have shown an ability to exit, albeit via SPAC and for relatively small numbers, modest returns. Critically, we believe that a market for quantum computing as a cloud service will materialize. These services may become a must-have for finance, help solve important logistics problems, and become a standard tool for pharma and advanced material companies. In 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $45.4B in revenues from its cloud services division (30 percent year growth). Quantum computing companies like IQM and Rigetti are already generating revenues from their cloud offerings. If some fraction of all cloud services is handled by quantum computers in the future, quantum computing providers would generate significant revenues.</p>
							<p>What are we looking for in a quantum computing company?</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li>Team: The team has a track record of hitting technical milestones, publishes research and findings to establish credibility with the scientific community, and can recruit strong talent. The team has connections to future customers and/or acquirers.</li>
								<li>Tech: We are looking for a technology that can be scaled to many logical qubits in a capital-efficient way, and be applied to a wide range of problems (approaching a universal quantum computer). Science risk is eliminated; the remaining technical risk is mostly engineering, i.e. there is a clear path to achieving the remaining technical milestones that don’t require miracles.</li>
								<li>Business: We want to see early engagement with future customers (companies like Amazon, pharma, finance, defense), and that the company will be able to tell a story about going public in the not-so-distant future.</li>

							<p class="subheading uppercase">A brief introduction</p>
							<p>Remember the first computer? Probably not.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Figure 2. Harwell Dekatron vacuum-tube (thermionic valve) computer. Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/edk7/12177956544" target="_blank">EDK7</a></p>
							<p>The on/off variations in electrical flow reflects the number of valves present in a computer system. These valves, also known as vacuum tubes, conduct and alter the flow of electricity, providing the necessary on/off signals. Valve computers were massive in size, sometimes filling a whole room, and they created a lot of heat, putting them at risk of burnout.</p>
							<p>Fast-forwarding 70 years, computers are built with circuits using tiny transistor components, enabling them to be both extremely powerful and miniaturized. But our ability to squeeze more transistors onto a silicon-based chip (the famous Moore’s Law) is nearing an end due to physical limitations. Researchers and companies are working on the next-generation technology to create more powerful computers that bring humanity past the silicon transistor era. A category of computers that solves problems in a fundamentally different way is Quantum computing: research, governments, and private companies are leading the way to bring this technology to fruition.</p>

							<p>The concept of quantum computers has existed since the 1970s. In the 1990s, researchers were comfortable enough with the concept of quantum computing to begin constructing creative algorithms (methods of solving problems) on it, assuming it existed. In 1994, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor" target="_blank">Peter Shor</a> developed his renowned method detailing how quantum computers might factor huge numbers while cracking RSA encryption. It's safe to assume that math came first, followed by engineering.</p>
							<p>A UC Berkeley/MIT/Los Alamos collaboration created the first quantum computer (with just two qubits) in 1998. Shor's algorithm was initially <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/12/011220081620.htm" target="_blank">demonstrated on a quantum computer in 2001</a> by scientists and Stanford graduate students at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose. These first quantum computers were little more than chemicals in a test tube.</p>
							<p>Quantum computer research and development has advanced dramatically since 2000. The discovery of new approaches to control the quantum states of atoms, electrons, and photons has increased the number of choices for constructing quantum computers. And the number of qubits achieved, as well as the number of businesses involved in quantum computing technology, has grown.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">What is a Quantum computer?</p>
							<p>A quantum computer is a system that performs calculations using qubits rather than bits. Bits are used as data units in traditional computers (zeros and ones). Quantum computers employ qubits, which may represent both zero and one at the same time due to a quantum mechanics phenomenon known as superposition.</p>
							<p>Quantum mechanics is the part of physics that looks at subatomic particles (the physics of things smaller than atoms): electrons, light, radio waves, and other forms of energy. For things bigger than atoms, and at speeds much lower than the speed of light, “classical” physics works just fine. When you get smaller or faster, classical physics falls apart — you need quantum mechanics to accurately describe things.</p>
							<p>At the quantum scale, three unique properties emerge: <b>superposition, entanglement, and tunneling</b>. These features allow quantum computers to be exponentially faster than today's mainframes and servers at solving some classes of problems. It also means that quantum computers should more accurately model physical, real-world systems at the atom scale - important for materials science and drug discovery, for example. Traditional computers can handle only a set of inputs and one calculation at a time. Quantum computers, using for example <b>n qubits</b>, can calculate <b>2<sup>n</sup> inputs at once</b>.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">What is a qubit?</p>
							<p>Quantum computers use qubits, which are <b>quantum bits supporting on, off, and in-between states</b>.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Superposition</p>
							<p>Qubits can represent a combination of both zero and one at the same time, based on a principle called superposition. Superposition is a state of a qubit where it is simultaneously on and off (like 30 percent zero and 70 percent one, for example). The superposition principle asserts that something – an electron, an atom, a photon — exists in all conceivable states simultaneously until it is measured. A famous example is the “Schrödinger's cat” experiment. As explained on Wikipedia, “Schrödinger's cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive" target="_blank">radioactive</a> source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter" target="_blank">Geiger counter</a>) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation" target="_blank">Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.”</p>

							<p>Superposition, in practice, allows future quantum computers to tackle problems that are too complicated for conventional (classical) computers by examining several potential configurations at once. In a nutshell, quantum computing is a sophisticated approach to making parallel calculations, using the physics that governs subatomic particles to replace the more simplistic transistors in today’s computers, as stated in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/12/what-is-quantum-computing" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Entanglement</p>
							<p>Two or more qubits whose quantum states are coupled (they share the same wavefunction) are called entanglement. Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated. This results in correlations between the systems' observable physical characteristics. For example, it is feasible to create two particles in a single quantum wave function so that when one is observed to be spin-up, the other is always observed to be spin-down and vice versa, despite the fact that quantum physics makes it impossible to anticipate which set of measurements will be observed.</p>
							<p>As a result, measurements made on one system appear to have an instantaneous impact on other systems that are entangled with it.</p>
							<p>Changing the state of an entangled qubit instantaneously changes the state of the paired qubit in quantum computers. As a result, entanglement accelerates the processing speed of quantum computers. Because processing one qubit reveals information about many qubits, doubling the number of qubits does not necessarily increase the number of processes (i.e. the entangled qubits).</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Quantum Supremacy</p>
							<p><b>The definition of quantum computing supremacy —</b> the point at which quantum computers can do jobs that conventional computers cannot <b>— is a hotly debated topic in the industry</b>.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Quantum Gates</p>
							<p>In order to process the qubits, as in classical computing, a quantum circuit applies gates (using for example microwaves or lasers) to manipulate the quantum information and finally compute an answer. There is one other technique, called quantum annealing which is used by the company D-Wave (one of the industry leaders). Quantum annealing is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions (candidate states), by a process using quantum fluctuations. It works well on very specific problems like optimization and, if you were interested, you can pick up a quantum annealing computer from D-Wave for $10-15 million.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Quantum Volume</p>
							<p>Quantum volume is a metric that considers the number of qubits, connectivity, and gate fidelity. The quantum’s volume numerical value is representative of the complexity of the specific problem solved by a quantum computer. The width and depth of a quantum circuit refer to the number of qubits and operations that may be done. The more sophisticated an algorithm the computer can perform, the deeper the circuit. The number of qubits, how qubits are coupled, gate and measurement errors, device cross-talk, circuit compiler efficiency, and other factors, all impact circuit depth.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Challenges with Quantum Computing</p>
							<p>There are several challenges, with the most significant being fault tolerance. <b>Qubits are extremely difficult to maintain</b>. Even the tiniest amount of noise (background radiation, electromagnetism, or a big sneeze) affects the qubit, rendering it meaningless. <b>Currently, it is believed that 1,000,000 physical qubits will contain only 1,000 usable qubits when error correction using the redundancy principle is applied</b>. Increasing the stability of qubits is paramount for creating a Quantum Universal Computer capable of handling any algorithm — a goal that is realistically yet 10-15 years away.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Quantum Computing Outlook</p>
							<p>IBM, Honeywell, IonQ, DWave, Xanadu, and Google have early versions of quantum computers. Today, they have tens of qubits. Unfortunately, today qubits are noisy, so tens of hundreds of thousands of qubits are needed to successfully solve real-world problems.</p>

							<p>There is no consensus, but the prediction for a useful quantum computer is to have 10k-1M qubits.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Figure 6. Different technologies for qubits. (Source: Michel Kurek, Feb 2021)</p>
							<p>Different qubits can be utilized to solve different challenges, depending on the application. For example, photons are good for quantum communication since they are the only qubits that can travel and be kept at room temperature indefinitely.</p>
							<p>Most IT giants – including Google, IBM, Intel – exploit the quantum characteristics of electrons in superconducting circuits to create quantum computers. That approach is also developed by large startups like Rigetti and IQM. Cryogenic temperatures (about 15 milli-Kelvin) are required for this. Superconducting qubits are the most researched and resourced approach to building quantum computers. These qubits consist of Josephson Junctions: a pair of superconducting metal strips separated by a tiny nanometer-wide gap that electrons cross, leading to quantum effects. The superconducting qubits are manipulated with microwave pulses (<a href="https://spie.org/news/photonics-focus/novdec-2020/a-new-kind-of-quantum?SSO=1" target="_blank">SPIE 2020</a>). These quantum computers require huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator" target="_blank">dilution refrigerators</a> (very different from your fridge at home!) to keep the qubits near absolute zero.</p>
							<p><b>Microsoft</b> is developing topological quantum computing. These more exotic “topological” qubits don’t store the information by changing the energy of particles but rather by affecting how the particles interact with each other — their topology. Topological qubits are, in theory, more stable than qubits encoded in individual particles but are also farther from commercialization. In topological quantum computers, the qubits are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon" target="_blank">anyons</a> (a little-known quasiparticle). Observing these quasiparticles was a huge physics breakthrough, and won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/10/04/2016-nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-three-men-for-revealing-the-secrets-of-exotic-matter" target="_blank">Washington Post explainer</a>). Topological qubits also require the chips to be held at low temperatures.</p>
							<p><b>D-Wave</b>, an industry leader, is developing quantum annealing computing. Quantum annealing is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions (candidate states), by a process using quantum fluctuations. It works well on very specific problems like optimization and if you were interested you can pick up a Quantum annealing computer from D-Wave for $10-15 million.</p>
							<p><b>Companies like IonQ and the conglomerate Honeywell are leading the charge in trapped-ion quantum computing, which involves trapping ions within a vacuum.</b> Ions (charged atoms or protons), can be confined and suspended in free space using electromagnetic fields. Qubits are stored in stable electronic states of each ion, and quantum information can be transferred through the collective quantized motion of the ions in a shared trap (interacting through the Coulomb force). Lasers induce coupling between the qubit states (for single qubit operations) or coupling between the internal qubit states and the external motional states (for entanglement between qubits).</p>
							<p><b>Atom Computing and Cold Quanta</b> are using neutral atoms as qubits. Like ion-trap systems, qubits can be programmed using the energy levels of the atoms. Light, or electromagnetic radiation, can be used to trap and manipulate the quantum states of uncharged (neutral) atoms. Multiple qubits that are nearby in space can be programmed to interact with one another via two-qubit gates. This opens up some tantalizing possibilities for exotic quantum-computing circuit topologies.</p>
							<p>The main hardware components constituting a neutral atom quantum processor are shown in Figure 7. The trapping laser light (in red) is shaped by the spatial light modulator (SLM) to produce multiple microtraps at the focal plane of the lens (see inset). The moving tweezers (in purple), dedicated to rearranging the atoms in the register, are controlled by a 2D acousto-optic laser beam deflector (AOD) and superimposed on the main trapping beam with a polarizing beam-splitter (PBS). The fluorescence light (in green) emitted by the atoms is split from the trapping laser light by a dichroic mirror and collected onto a camera.

							<p>Neutral atom platforms for quantum processing have a unique potential for scalability: <b>the size of the quantum register is only limited by the amount of trapping laser power and by the performance of the optical system generating the optical tweezers</b>.</p>
							<p>Quantum computers based on <b>Silicon Photonics</b> use single photons in silicon photonic waveguides (i.e. pipes for photons) and are then manipulated using networks of optical components. PsiQuantum and <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/hardware" target="_blank">Xanadu</a> are working on this approach.</p>
							<p>The startup <b>EeroQ uses electrons on the surface of liquid helium</b> as qubits.</p>
							<p>Other approaches are still in development, including using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds as qubits, and silicon quantum dots.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">General Quantum Computer Metrics</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li><b>The total number of (physical) qubits demonstrated:</b> less than 100. The current record is from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-stakes-claim-quantum-supremacy" target="_blank">China with 76 qubits</a>. There is confusion around the D-Wave claim and its 5k qubit machines. Larger quantum machines tend to have lower connectivity, which means that the qubits can’t communicate with one another quite as well. This lack of connectivity lowers the system’s overall computing power.</li>
								<li><b>How many qubits are needed for a useful system?</b> 10k-1M (estimated).</li>
								<li><b>Number of qubit gates:</b> A quantum gate is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.</li>
								<li><b>Coherence time:</b> How long can the qubits store information? Keeping the qubits in their states long enough to do a calculation is hard. This property is called <b>coherence</b>. Several factors can disturb a quantum state: temperature fluctuations, vibrations, etc. Quantum computer designers have to go to great lengths to isolate the qubits from the rest of the world.</li>
								<li><b>Error rate</b>: Quantum computers are error-prone machines. These computing errors are inherent in quantum systems and cannot be avoided in and of themselves. That's why a lot of money and expertise is being spent on quantum error detection and determining how to construct machines that can identify and repair their own faults. Although considerable progress has been achieved in this field, it is doubtful that quantum mistakes will ever be completely eliminated. Even with very precise quantum computers, classical computers will be required to validate the final output. Quantum computers need thousands of logical qubits to do meaningful calculations. If many of the quantum computer’s qubits are subject to error, or rapidly decohere and lose the information they stored, <b>it may take more than 1,000 physical qubits to make a single logical qubit</b>.</li>
								<li><b>Energy consumption:</b> At the moment, quantum machines are not efficient from a power consumption point of view.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The <b>DiVincenzo criteria</b> are conditions necessary for constructing a quantum computer. They were proposed in 2000 by the theoretical physicist David P. DiVincenzo. The criteria prescribe a computer that would be able to efficiently simulate quantum systems, such as in solving the quantum many-body problem. (These criteria build on the ideas proposed by mathematician Yuri Manin in 1980, and physicist Richard Feynman in 1982.)</p>
							<p>DiVincenzo Criteria can be helpful in evaluating a startup quantum computing technology:</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li>A scalable physical system with well-characterized qubits.</li>
								<li>The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state. One simple way to initialize a qubit is to wait long enough for the qubit to relax to its energy ground state. In addition, controlling the qubit potential by the tuning knobs allows faster initialization mechanisms.</li>
								<li>Long relevant decoherence times.</li>
								<li>A “universal” set of quantum gates.</li>
								<li>A qubit-specific measurement capability.</li>

							<h4>Applications</h4>
							<p>Quantum computer architecture is inherently different and has different strengths (and weaknesses) than classical computers, including:</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li><b>Memory:</b> Classical computers can store information for long periods of time. By contrast, a quantum computer’s “memory” only lasts a few microseconds. Quantum memory is an active area of research for communication applications.</li>
								<li><b>Architecture/how much space the computer occupies:</b> Most quantum computers require ultra-low temperatures close to absolute zero (-270 degrees Celsius or -450 degrees Fahrenheit) and/or advanced optics to run.</li>
								<li>Classical and quantum computers are <b>good at solving different problems</b> (algorithms).</li>

							<p>The earliest generation of the technology was the passive electronically steeredsultaneously in different directions. Texas startup <a href="https://www.cesiumastro.com" target="_blank">CesiumAstro</a> recently completed a $60M Series B financing round for their modular AESA platform [29].</p>

							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note on beam forming vs beam steering. Beam forming is using superposition to create the beam. Beam steering is dynamically changing that beam’s direction.</p>
							<p>Digital Beam Forming (DBF) based phased arrays have digital receivers connected to each antenna element. As the signal is digitized at each of the antenna elements by thsna) market is projected to have a CAGR of ~41 percent from 2021-2026 [30].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Electric Propulsion</p>
							<p>In-space propulsion has a sizeable design space, as illustrated below, with a half dozen different options available to complete the standard tasks of a satellites’ mission life, such as station keeping, maneuvering to avoid debris, and end-of-life retirement moves (deorbit for LEO or park in graveyard orbit about GEO).</p>
							
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: thousands of satellites burning up in the atmosphere has the unintentional side-effect of being a geoengineering experiment to slow climate change. One way to mitigate solar radiation is via dispersal of aluminum particles.</p>
							<p>Shorter mission life cosll fire for long durations, periodically turning off to deal with thermal heat soak, and can take many months to get a satellite to its final orbit.</p>
							<p>Due to the low thrust of electric propulsors, the thrusters begin firing days before predicted conjunction for satellites to maneuver out of the way of orbital debris. <a href="https://orbionspace.com" target="_blank">Orbion Space Technology</a> was recently awarded a Phase II SBIR from AFWERX to develop a solution for little-to-no-warning debris collision avoidance maneuvers, blending their Hall thruster with an emergency store of cold gas to increase the thrust [32].</p>
							
							<p>For brevity sake, I won’t cover technical details on the half dozen different types of electric thrusters. For those who are curious about the most ubiquitous fosn an $83M post-money valuation [36]. The global space propulsion market is projected to have a CAGR of ~16 percent from 2020-2025 [37].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Inter-Satellite Links</p>
							<p>Enabling satellites to communicate directly with one another and to pass on information is the osto RF. OISLs use a narrow beam of light to communicate and require a direct line of sight to minimize interference. This makes OISLs robust against jamming and eavesdropping (a bad actor would have to intercept along the line of sight path directly).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/quantum-computing/x-09.gif">
							<p class="small-caption">Optical Intersatellite Links – space is the ideal environment for laser-based communications [38]</p>
							<p>The DOD and NASA have programs testing inter-satellite links, such as DARPA’s BlackJack progrshardware for the Space Development Agency (SDA) [41]. The SDA utilizes a more modern ‘portfolio approach’ to capabilities development, which means they have another shot-on-goal via an award to optical communications startups <a href="http://bridgecomminc.com" target="_blank">BridgeComm</a> and <a href="https://www.spacemicro.com" target="_blank">Space Micro</a>, who are developing an optical one-to-many links that can do point-to-multipoint transmission [42]. The commercial satellite industry’s need for optical inter-satellite links accelerated the development and adoption timelines. Several commercial OISL providers have successfully demonstrated their technology, including <a href="https://www.tesat.de" target="_blank">Tesat-Spacecom</a> [43] and <a href="https://mynaric.com" target="_blank">Mynaric</a> [44].</p>

							<h4>Commercial Satellite Market</h4>
							<p>The satellite industry clocks in at $271B as of 2020 [52]. The SATCOM portion of that market is currently ~$22B (minus the part of the telecommunications market that is focused on television and radio).</p>

							<h4>Market Stratification</h4>
							<p>The SATCOM market can be stratified into the following segments: Fixed Broadband, Mobile (air, maritime, auto), IoT, 5G Backhaul, and Orbital Data Relays.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Fixed Broadband</p>
							<p>Fixed broadband refers to satellites beaming the internet to your home/office. The competitors in spportunity at $9.3B, with $4.7B coming from the U.S. and Europe [57].</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s note: seasoned SATCOM consultants are providing the historical counter-perspective and asking good questions [58].</p>
							<p>I am optimistic for this market, if only because there are so many parts of the country without goos“Can Starlink Save the American Mother?” [60].)</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/quantum-computing/x-14.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Red zones are places where over 25% of the population reports no internet access! [61]</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Mobile Broadband</p>
							<p>Mobile broadband refers to satellites beaming the internet to large things that move, like airps beam hopping design this year and is working with startup SatixFy on an airplane terminal that supports beam hopping and is compatible with both OneWeb’s LEO satellite and GEO providers [62]. In March 2022, <a href="https://www.satixfy.com" target="_blank">SatixFy</a> announced their intention to SPAC at a $239M valuation, including a $29M PIPE [63]. The aeronautical market growth is projected to be between 8-11 percent [64], while the maritime market is segmented with expected to grow between 1.8-2.4 percent [65].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">5G Backhaul – Intriguing New Players</p>
							<p>Earlier we learned that the universal terminal is the dream. Instead of working on a new terminal design, what if the existing antennas in everyone’s pocket worked? Two startups are working on satellites that can communicate directly with cell phones: <a href="https://lynk.world" target="_blank">Lynk</a> and Reddit darling <a href="https://ast-science.com/spacemobile" target="_blank">AST SpaceMobile</a> (NASDAQ ticker $ASTS) [10]. SATCOM is a physics-bounded process. In order to communicate, something has to be “stronsitially be a global text messaging service with potential for more if things progress well.</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">IoT</p>
							<p>One could make just as large a table for proposed IoT constellations as I did earlier for broadband. The market here is nascent, sitting around $1B in size today psdscape here, I again chose to focus on companies with satellites in orbit. Companies to consider tracking include <a href="https://swarm.space" target="_blank">Swarm</a> (what will SpaceX do with the acquired IP from their undisclosed size deal [74]?), startup <a href="https://fleetspace.com" target="_blank">Fleet Space</a> (who closed a $26M round last year [75] and received a $20M grant from the Australian government [76]), and <a href="https://www.astrocast.com" target="_blank">Astrocast</a> (who IPO’d on the Euronext Growth Oslo exchange last August [77]). It’s also worth noting legacy players Orbcomm, Iridium, and Globalstar all have systems that service the IoT market. In fact, Iridium’s recent positive earnings was mostly attributed to IoT growth – <em>“Iridium’s commercial IoT subscribers grew 24% from the year-ago period to 1,193,000 customers, driven by continued strength in consumer personal communications devices. IoT Data subscribers now represent 76% of billable commercial subscribers.”</em> [78].</p>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Orbital Data Relays</p>
							<p>Orbital data relays were once the domain of governments. The earliest example is NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay Ssata relay system, linking with the ISS and other EU assets [81]. Toronto startup <a href="https://kepler.space" target="_blank">Kepler Communications</a>, who raised a $60M round last year, is creating what they term an in-space internet infrastructure [82].</p>
							<p>The other benefit of orbital relays is extracting more value from Earth Observation (EO) datas Twitter was relying on days-old data from EO providers to make their threat assessments. At SmallSat Symposium in February 2022, the concept of <b>timeliness of data</b> was repeatedly brought up in panel discussions. One startup working to alleviate this problem is <a href="https://www.eosspacelink.com" target="_blank">SpaceLink</a>, who are creating a MEO constellation with optical intersatellite links [83]. They plan to provide customers a way to aggregate more of their data and get it downlinked, to enable near real-time data collection. Another startup, <a href="https://www.mangatanetworks.com" target="_blank">Mangata Networks</a>, is looking to build a MEO - HEO satellite communications network and combine it with their terrestrial data processing [84].</p>
							<p class="author-notes">Author’s Note: in addition to timeliness of data, another repeated topic at Smasntage of existing terrestrial compute. For edge compute, companies like <a href="https://ramon.space" target="_blank">Ramon.Space</a> are working on spacss. Two newer companies to track in this sector include a systems solution, <a href="https://nebulacompute.com" target="_blank">Nebula Compute</a>, and a materials supplier, <a href="https://cosmicshielding.com" target="_blank">Cosmic Shielding Corporation</a>.</p>

							<h4>Regulatory Environment</h4>
							<p>Spectrum is an incredibly valuable finite resource. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) holds auctions for specific frequencies, typically netting tens of billions of dollars each time. The tricky part about spectrum allocations in the U.S. is that it’s not only frequency dependent, but also local area dependent. (For example, a company can be licensed in one county of a state but not others.) The below chart illustrates the U.S. frequency allocations.</p>
