							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>In our relentless pursuit of greater power densities, the transition from rudimentary energy sources such as wood to the sophistication of nuclear power encapsulates humanity's continuous quest for more efficient, powerful, and cleaner energy solutions. This journey, as detailed in Vaclav Smil's <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4023/Power-DensityA-Key-to-Understanding-Energy-Sources" target="_blank">Power Density</a>, highlights significant leaps in our ability to harness energy more densely and efficiently, driven by groundbreaking scientific and technological innovations. With the US goal to create a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050, our exploration for dense energy sources enters a critical phase. Two pivotal considerations emerge in this context: first, while solar and wind have dominated the clean energy discourse, their intermittent (low capacity) nature poses challenges without viable and cost-effective long-term energy storage. Second, despite the potential of nuclear energy — both fission and fusion — to contribute to carbon-neutral energy grids, as seen in countries like Sweden and France, it is beset by technical, psychological, and regulatory challenges, stemming from historical mishaps and public apprehension.</p>
							<p>Yet, beneath our feet lies an untapped subterranean powerhouse—a vast reservoir of heat trapped within rock known as geothermal energy. To put its potential into perspective, a <a href="https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-geothermal-energy" target="_blank">2005 MIT report</a> estimated that the US geothermal resource base exceeds the country's annual energy consumption by more than 100,000 times, with a conservative estimate suggesting that the recoverable geothermal resources could meet 2,000 times our total annual energy demand. Despite this, geothermal energy contributed a mere 0.2% to the US energy mix in 2022, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity_generation/pdf/AEO2023_LCOE_report.pdf" target="_blank">EIA</a>.</p>

							<p>Elevating geothermal energy from its niche status to a major contender in the global energy market necessitates a significant leap in energy output per well, alongside achieving cost-effectiveness and appropriate risk adjustment. For investors and industry stakeholders, understanding where to direct capital for maximum impact is key. This includes focusing on areas of innovations that show promise to shift the cost dynamics of geothermal energy production.</p>

							<h4>Background</h4>
							<p class="subheading">Geothermal Today - Open or Closed?</p>
							<p>At its core, extracting thermal energy from the Earth's depths revolves around two key challenges: accessing the vast reservoirs of energy below the surface and efficiently transferring that energy to where it can be utilized. This process typically involves the use of working fluids to facilitate heat transfer, leading to a division in the geothermal industry based on the method of fluid routing: open-loop and closed-loop systems.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/longesuperhot-rock-geothermal/x-02.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Comparison between conventional and next-generation geothermal systems. Image source: <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power" target="_blank">DOE’s Geothermal Commercial Liftoff Report</a></p>
							<p>Open-loop systems have been the traditional backbone of geothermal energy production. These systems capitalize on either naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs or engineered reservoirs created through enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). These setups require the circulation of significant volumes of working fluid, often facing the challenge of overcoming high friction pressures when pumping through subsurface fractures to maintain effective flow. In contrast, closed-loop systems, also called advanced geothermal systems (AGS), confine the working fluid within engineered conduits, acting as underground “radiators” that transfer heat through conduction. This configuration offers a wider choice of working fluids due to its sealed nature but necessitates extensive surface area contact between the conduits and the hot rocks for efficient heat extraction.</p>
							<p>The journey of geothermal energy from the construction of the first geothermal plant in 1904, harnessing natural steam, to the present day, showcases a slow but steady progression. Despite over a century of innovation, the widespread adoption of geothermal energy has been markedly slow, largely hindered by economic barriers. To date, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for geothermal has not been competitive enough to spur broad-scale deployment as compared to natural gas, solar, and wind. However, we are starting to see the emergence of the inflection point for geothermal energy, thanks to technological advancements aimed at accessing deeper, hotter reservoirs. Tapping into such resources could dramatically increase the electricity production capacities from the conventional 3-5 MW per well to 50-100 MW per well, fundamentally changing the economics and viability of geothermal energy.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Going Deeper: The Supercritical Advantage</p>
							<p>In the evolving landscape of renewable energy, power density stands as the pivotal metric, defining the amount of power generated per unit area. Elevated power densities enable the generation of substantial energy from minimal land use, significantly reducing both capital expenditures and environmental impacts, while simultaneously enhancing output efficiency. The power output from a geothermal reservoir is significantly influenced by three factors: the enthalpy of the working fluid, the mass flow rate of the production wells, and the energy cycle efficiency of converting the thermal energy into electric power.</p>
							<p>Enthalpy measures the thermal energy that geothermal fluids can carry from the Earth's interior to the surface, directly impacting the potential for power generation. The value proposition of geothermal energy can be transformed by reaching depths where geothermal fluids become supercritical, which exists at conditions where fluids surpass their critical temperature and pressure—water, for instance, becomes supercritical at 374°C and 22 MPa. At these supercritical states, also known as ‘superhot’, the conventional boundaries between liquid and gas phases dissolve, allowing the fluids to exhibit both enhanced enthalpy and increased mass transport rates. This unique combination facilitates the transport of greater amounts of thermal energy and higher heat-to-power conversion cycle efficiencies.</p>

							<p>Superhot rock (SHR) geothermal resources capitalize on this supercritical advantage. By drilling deeper beyond the current depths of hydrothermal and EGS systems, and into regions where rocks are at temperatures above 400-450°C, SHR has the potential to increase the power output per well by 5-10 times compared to current EGS projects. The higher power output achievable per well means that SHR can extract more heat using far fewer wells, leading to a reduced environmental footprint. Specifically, SHR operations will necessitate less than one-tenth the land and water usage of conventional geothermal systems. Finally, the LCOE for SHR is projected to undercut that of natural gas, marking a turning point for its economic viability and setting the stage for broader adoption.</p>

							<p class="small-caption">Compared to conventional geothermal, superhot rock systems are deeper, providing access to hotter dry rock systems. Image source: <a href="https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/21171446/superhot-rock-energy-report.pdf" target="_blank">CATF Report</a></p>
							<p>The Earth's crust is a complex tapestry of materials and conditions that govern the behavior of rocks under various conditions. Near the surface, rocks exhibit a brittle nature, breaking under limited deformation. This characteristic changes profoundly as we delve deeper, following the earth’s thermal gradient, marking a critical consideration for SHR geothermal energy extraction. The journey through the Earth's crust reveals two distinct phases of rock behavior that are pivotal to unlocking geothermal potential.</p>
							<p>Initially, as depth and confining stress increase, rock strength also rises. In this phase, prevalent in most current geothermal drilling projects, rocks retain their brittle nature, containing open fractures or being susceptible to induced fracturing, thus exhibiting high permeability. This environment is conducive to the development of both hydrothermal and EGS, where natural and artificially created fractures form conduits for geothermal fluid flow, enabling effective heat extraction by circulating a reservoir fluid.</p>
							<p>With further increases in confining stress and temperature, a significant transformation occurs—the mechanical behavior of rocks shifts from brittle to ductile. This transition, occurring in the Brittle-Ductile Transition (BDT) zone, results in rocks that can undergo extensive deformation without abrupt failure. However, this ductility comes at a cost: fractures begin to close under the plastic flow of the rock matrix, diminishing permeability and impeding fluid flow and heat transfer to the shallow subsurface. The BDT zone's depth and temperature thresholds vary, typically occurring around 350-400°C and depths of 10-15 km, though this can vary in regions with active magmatism.</p>
							<p>So the key to unlocking SHR energy lies in determining what depth it can be found and devising methods to effectively extract it. Successfully harnessing the power of SHR demands not just technical innovation but a deep understanding of the geological variables that define this unique energy landscape. Drilling and exploration must be done at temperatures and pressures that far exceed even the most advanced oil and gas capabilities and extraction of the thermal energy is markedly different from EGS. Since the energy resource is geographically ubiquitous, solving these challenges could potentially make SHR accessible worldwide.</p>

							<h4>Key Technical Areas of Focus</h4>
							<p>Recent funding initiatives, such as a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521546993/en/Geothermal-Innovator-XGS-Energy-Completes-Oversubscribed-20M-Capital-Raise" target="_blank">$20 million additional Series A fund for XGS Energy</a> and the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-60-million-expand-clean-renewable-geothermal-energy" target="_blank">Biden-Harris Administration’s $60 million investment</a> in three EGS projects (Chevron New Energies, Fervo Energy, and Mazama Energy), alongside the <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power" target="_blank">DOE’s Geothermal Commercial Liftoff Report</a>, underscore the government’s commitment to advancing geothermal energy and investor interests. This focus is crucial as these projects and technologies pave the way towards the development of SHR geothermal energy, aiming to make geothermal power cost-competitive and scalable.</p>
							<p>Previously, we introduced SHR geothermal energy, discussing its potential economic viability due to its high temperatures and unique geographic characteristics. While the prospects are promising, significant challenges remain, prompting questions about the feasibility of pursuing geothermal 2.0 when the current “next-generation geothermal” technologies — EGS & AGS — have yet to achieve widespread deployment. </p>
							<p>Just as it took over two decades to economically extract shale gas, EGS and AGS have been under development for many years, with commercial activities only recently gaining momentum. This highlights two critical points: geothermal projects are capital-intensive and have long development timelines. Delays in deployment will eventually strain the industry and supply chains, and complicate our efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, a challenge also faced by the nuclear energy sector.</p>
							<p>Thus, it is imperative to outline the necessary steps to make geothermal energy cost-effective and competitive with future energy sources. It is worth recognizing that this is not a winner-takes-all scenario. In the near term, EGS and AGS systems will continue to be developed and refined as they are now. As we advance our ability to harness deeper geothermal resources, the role of SHR geothermal energy will gradually increase, complementing the existing systems and contributing to a diversified and resilient energy landscape.</p>
