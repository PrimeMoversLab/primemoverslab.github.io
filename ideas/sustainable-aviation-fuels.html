							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>AgAs governments and consumers signal greater demand for sustainability in every part of the economy, aviation is no exception. Over 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions come from aviation, and major airlines and industry trade associations have set targets of net-zero carbon emissions for air travel by 2050. This requires <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23922939/airline-united-climate-change-sustainable-fuel-emissions-offset-saf" target="_blank">switching away from fossil fuels</a> toward <b>sustainable aviation fuels</b> (or “SAF”), such as biofuels or synthetic kerosene. Government incentives are also making the space attractive for investment. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for example, offers tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon of SAF (compared to jet fuel costs <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMA_EPJK_PWG_NUS_DPG&f=M" target="_blank">ranging from $1 to $4</a>), depending on the extent of reduction in CO2 emissions.</p>
							<p>Yet global SAF production was only 80 million gallons in 2022, less than 0.1% of the ~100 billion gallons of aviation fuel consumed annually. More than 130 SAF projects have now been announced that could expand annual production to as much as <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2023-releases/2023-06-06-01" target="_blank">18 billion gallons</a> in 2028, but sustained growth and innovation are clearly needed to achieve net zero emissions targets. Technology to produce sustainable fuels has existed for decades. The question is whether it can be cost-effective, energy-efficient, and scaled to meet the rising global demand. This paper examines the technical and economic hurdles facing large scale adoption of SAF and the landscape of companies innovating to meet the challenge.</p>

							<h4>Background</h4>
							<p class="subheading">Why SAF and Why Now</p>
							<p>Why not transition away entirely from hydrocarbon fuel like today’s kerosene jet fuel and towards hydrogen or battery-powered aircraft? Two big reasons are the space and weight constraints of aircraft and the long development and investment timeline to onboard novel propulsion systems.</p>
							<p>Commercial airliners require a power source with <a href="https://medium.com/@celions/decarbonizing-aviation-energy-density-deadacf72b34" target="_blank">high energy density</a>, especially for long-haul flights which contribute the bulk of the industry’s CO2 emissions. Hydrocarbon fuels are inherently advantaged in this regard. Compared to kerosene jet fuel, today’s batteries supplying equivalent energy would weigh 40 times as much. Liquid hydrogen would take up 4 times the amount of space and would have to be stored at a temperature of -250°C. In that sense, hydrocarbon fuels can be thought of as a kind of “liquid battery” that is especially stable, transportable, and dense. But to put it in perspective, one gallon of kerosene would have the energy capacity of nearly 10,000 AA batteries (although electric motors are more efficient than turbine engines at using that energy).</p>
							<p>Hydrogen propulsion also faces a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20transport%20and%20logistics/our%20insights/scaling%20sustainable%20aviation%20fuel%20today%20for%20clean%20skies%20tomorrow/clean-skies-for-tomorrow.pdf" target="_blank">chicken-and-egg problem</a>. Airlines need to invest in new aircraft which still require decades of development, but they won’t do it until the infrastructure is ready for all of the airports where they might be used. And hydrogen may not be the clean-combusting fuel some imagine. Since it burns so hot, it can form more environment-damaging NOX emissions than hydrocarbon fuels do. Companies like <a href="https://zeroavia.com">ZeroAvia</a> are paving the way for hydrogen-powered aviation with solutions like H2-electric engines, but there is value in enabling decarbonization with existing aircraft and infrastructure.</p>
							<p>That’s not to say all the advancements and investments in clean energy and green hydrogen don’t have a role to play in clean air travel now. On the contrary, hydrogen is a key ingredient in most of the approaches to produce SAF, and recent innovations and incentives to reduce the cost of electrolysis are key enablers for why SAF has been receiving more attention.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Carbon-Based Fuel as Part of a Circular Energy Economy</p>
							<p>To see how SAF like biofuels or synthetic kerosene can be a part of a circular energy economy, it helps to think a bit about the chemistry of fuels and combustion. Transportation fuels are hydrocarbons, molecules containing primarily hydrogen and carbon atoms bonded to each other in chains of various sizes and shapes. When hydrocarbon fuel burns in an engine, it reacts with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen and carbon atoms break apart from each other and form new bonds with oxygen, producing water (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and lots of heat (energy). The expansion of hot gases can be harnessed to, e.g., spin a turbine, push a piston connected to a drivetrain, or propel an aircraft from the thrust of the gases.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/sustainable-aviation-fuels/x-01.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in an engine produces CO<sub>2</sub>, water, and lots of heat. The energy from the expulsion of hot gaseous products can be harnessed for propulsion.</p>
							<p>The path to sustainable fuel is exactly the reverse of combustion: energy is harnessed to convert the ingredients of water and CO2 back into fuel while putting oxygen back into the air. Whether this process happens inside a photosynthesizing plant or using electricity, the process is remarkably similar. Green plants and algae use the energy of the sun to split water, using hydrogen to fix CO2 into carbon-containing biomass like wood, starches, or oils, which can be converted into biofuels. Electricity can be used instead of sunlight to split water and <a href="https://medium.com/prime-movers-lab/carbon-capture-part-i-147c0d64ca29" target="_blank">captured CO2</a>, first forming intermediates like hydrogen gas (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) or methanol and then ultimately synthesizing a kerosene equivalent fuel. This latter process is often called power-to-liquid (PtL). In either case, H2O supplies the hydrogen content, CO2 supplies the carbon content, oxygen is removed, and energy is required.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/sustainable-aviation-fuels/x-02.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">A circular fuel economy with SAF: Combustion with oxygen in a jet engine produces energy and emits CO2 and water. Energy from the sun or the grid can convert CO2 and water back to SAF and oxygen, either via biomass (e.g. wood, sugars, algae, vegetable oils) or a power-to-liquid (PtL) process. Processing to convert biomass into SAF also emits CO2, but the process can still be circular since the biomass originated from atmospheric CO2.</p>
							<p>The overall process could be circular and sustainable if all carbon-containing compounds in the process originated from atmospheric CO2. This would mean all chemical reactors and other equipment in the production process would run on zero-emissions electricity and/or burn only fuels that are likewise sustainable. In practice, there are still lifecycle emissions inherent in all currently available renewable energy sources. Every step in a SAF production process must therefore be highly efficient, as any inefficiencies impact the yield and require overbuilding the feedstock or clean energy supply. Other barriers to sustainability (and cost) include whether the fuel composition of SAF can truly allow drop-in replacement and how to address other warming effects from aviation contrails related to fuel composition.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Composition of Fossil Fuel and of SAF</p>
							<p>Different types of fuel (e.g. gasoline, jet fuel, diesel) have different compositions of hydrocarbons tailored toward certain physical and combustion properties. Since SAF is a product intended to replace fossil fuel, it helps to introduce some of the basic chemistry of fossil fuels, to give context for what SAF manufacturers are trying to produce and how.</p>
							<p>Crude oil from the ground contains hydrocarbon chains of various shapes and sizes that can be separated by boiling in a distillation column and collecting fractions at different temperatures in the column. Lighter, or more volatile, fractions tend to comprise hydrocarbon molecules with shorter chains. The fraction called <b>kerosene</b> consists mainly of hydrocarbons with ~8-16 carbons and is the main component of jet fuel. It is intermediate between <b>naphtha</b> (~4-12 carbons), which is primarily used in gasoline, and <b>diesel</b> (~12-20 carbons).</p>
							<p>Hydrocarbons can also be classified by molecule shape, which has an impact on a fuel’s properties. Jet fuel contains a mixture of paraffins (straight-chained hydrocarbons) and isoparaffins (branched hydrocarbons), as well as aromatics (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene) and some naphthenes (a.k.a. cycloparaffins). These compounds are all found in crude oil, but fuel composition can also be modified through operations at an oil refinery. Hydrocracking enables the breakdown of heavier paraffins using a small amount of hydrogen, and an isomerization unit can convert paraffins into branched isoparaffins. Aromatics can also be synthesized through catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons in the naphtha range.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/sustainable-aviation-fuels/x-03.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Four types of hydrocarbons (paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and three oil refinery operations that alter the hydrocarbon composition in fuel.</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.astm.org" target="_blank">STM International</a> is the entity that sets standards and performance criteria for aviation fuel composition. One specification, for example, is that the melting/freezing point of jet fuel must be no higher than -40°C. Isoparaffins in the blend help to meet this spec, as they have much lower freezing points than paraffins of the same weight. It is also necessary for aromatics to comprise between 8-25% of the jet fuel. Because of the different solvent properties of aromatics versus paraffins, fuel compositions outside this range might cause shrinking or swelling of Orings fitted in the fuel lines, resulting in fuel leakage, which would be a major problem. Making a fully drop-in SAF is therefore more complicated than producing one type of hydrocarbon.</p>

							<h4>Approaches to Producing Aviation-Compliant SAF</h4>
							<p>There are a number of companies and approaches to produce SAF from different feedstocks, and <a href="
								https://www.ctvc.co/high-flying-fuels/?ref=ctvc-by-sightline-climate-newsletter" target="_blank">recent</a> articles review them in detail. But briefly, most approaches can be grouped into one of three categories based on the final step to transform chemical precursors to hydrocarbons:</p>
							<p><b>1. HEFA (Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids):</b>Conversion of vegetable or animal fats/oils, such as used cooking oil.</p>
							<p><b>AtJ (Alcohol-to-jet):</b> Conversion of alcohols, such as ethanol or methanol, in a multistep process. The actual processes and catalysts differ depending on the alcohol (methanol, ethanol, isobutanol) but share broad similarities in the types of catalysts used. The alcohols may be from the fermentation of corn or other sugars or could be synthesized from CO2 and electricity using new electrolyzer technologies.</p>
							<p><b>FT (Fischer-Tropsch process):</b> Conversion of synthesis gas, or “syngas”, a mixture containing both hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a ~2:1 ratio. The syngas could be produced from the gasification of biomass, or using green hydrogen and CO2.</p>
							<p>These categories could be further split based on whether the precursors come from biomass feedstocks (biofuels) or synthesized from CO2 in a PtL process. Other methods that don’t fit in these three categories include pyrolysis of woody biomass or hydrothermal liquefaction of wet organic matter such as sewage or algae. Those methods result directly in a crude oil-like mixture which could be further refined.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/sustainable-aviation-fuels/x-04.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Three major routes and example schemes for producing synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK): Hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA), exemplified here by <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/39732" target="_blank">Honeywell/UOP’s Ecofining process</a>; Alcohol-to-jet (AtJ), exemplified here by <a href="https://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IEA-Bioenergy-Task-39-Progress-in-the-commercialisation-of-biojet-fuels-May-2021-1.pdf" target="_blank">LanzaJet’s ethanol-to-jet process</a>; Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalytic synthesis of paraffins from syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide).</p>
							<p>Each SAF production approach uses special catalysts and reaction conditions to effect the respective transformation, and the output of each is primarily paraffins. Refinery operations like hydrocracking, isomerization, and distillation can be used to formulate a product in the kerosene (~8-16 carbon chain) range, but still with little or no aromatics. The resulting “synthetic paraffinic kerosene,” or SPK, is approved for up to 50% blending with fossil jet fuel. Standard fossil jet fuel is ~17% aromatics, so even a 50% blend of SPK retains the minimum 8% needed.</p>
							<p>Notably, the low aromatic content of SPK actually makes it cleaner burning than its fossil counterpart in ways that impact both air quality and climate change beyond CO2 emissions. Aromatics don’t always fully combust and may leave behind smog particulates. These can nucleate aviation contrails that function as a kind of thermal insulation in their own right. By some estimates, these aviation contrails may contribute to atmospheric warming to the same extent as the CO2 emissions themselves. So more substitution of fossil jet fuel with SPK brings immediate climate and environmental benefits.</p>
							<p>In the long term, achieving 100% SAF will require new methods of producing or upgrading SAF to contain aromatics, or else upgrading all fuel line Orings to a new material so that aromatics are not required. The company Virent already has a process to synthesize aromatics from plant-based sugars, approved as synthetic aromatic kerosene (SAK). Virent supplied SAK for Virgin Atlantic’s recent 100% SAF-based flight from London to New York, conferring 12% aromatics alongside the 88% HEFA supplied by AirBP. The groundbreaking flight offered a demonstration of the aspirational future of air travel.</p>

							<h4>The Road to Affordable SAF: A Feedstock Cost Analysis</h4>
							<p>At a price of only ~$2.50-$3.00 per gallon, jet fuel is cheap. Yet airlines often still have <a href="https://simpleflying.com/airlines-thin-margins-analysis" target="_blank">very thin margins</a>, and despite aggressive targets for adopting SAF it won’t be realistic for airlines to pay any significant premium on fuel.<sup>[1]</sup> Are any routes to SAF cost-competitive with fossil jet fuel, and if not, could they ever be?</p>
							<p>The cost of producing SAF with any given method depends on many factors, and assessing the contributions of capital, utilities, feedstock, and other fixed and variable costs to SAF price would entail a full technoeconomic analysis. But a simple treatment based on feedstock costs alone can give great insight into which approaches to SAF might be most promising. This section compares the costs and other challenges of using different feedstocks for SAF (e.g. oils, alcohols, syngas), beginning with biomass before turning to e-fuels, or SAF made from CO2 and electricity.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Vegetable or Cooking Oils (HEFA)</p>
							<p>The HEFA pathway can be used to produce SAF from vegetable oils like soybean or corn oil, used directly or collected after use as cooking oil. This is the <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/120623-saf-production-to-triple-to-15-mil-mt-in-2024-but-progress-slow-iata" target="_blank">primary production pathway for SAF now</a>, and is expected to fulfill the majority of expanded capacity through the decade to meet 2030 targets of ~5% of total jet fuel consumption (~5 billion gallons or 14 million tonnes). Beyond that, however, the supply of these oils will be constrained (there is only so much cooking going on at your favorite fast food restaurant), <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/is-the-biofuel-industry-approaching-a-feedstock-crunch" target="_blank">and it is already</a> becoming so.</p>
							<p>Used cooking oil for biofuel has been as low as $550/t <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/articles-and-reports/increasing-volatility-drives-increased-opportunities-for-hedging-in-waste-oils.html" target="_blank">in 2019</a>, but has <a href="https://www.fastmarkets.com/agriculture/biofuels" target="_blank">more recently</a> risen to the $1100–1700/t range. Due to the inherent chemistry of, for example, Honeywell-UOP’s <a href="https://pmt.honeywell.com/learnmore/ecofining/ebook?utm_source=hon-email&utm_medium=organic-email&utm_campaign=202106-UOP-GL-SAF-Communication&utm_content=other&utm_term=null&mkt_tok=ODI4LURITC02ODUAAAF912MscusyNR5WSwyTAvswEwONa8Q3ClK-ze2ewOAQQaiIKBLMyS2hq0BXRiKyLzsWJkRztKsjlM-VzbvonF0" target="_blank">Ecofining</a> process, the maximum possible yield is ~0.8 tonnes of paraffin per tonne of feedstock oil. Assuming $1100/t feedstock oil, a lower bound for HEFA price would be ~$1400/t or <b>$4.15/gal</b>. To reiterate, this lower bound reflects only the contribution of the oil feedstock toward final cost. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-target-faces-cost-margin-challenges-2023-11-01" target="_blank">SAF currently retails at nearly $7/gal</a>, so there seems to be room for costs to come down, but there does not seem to be a path for HEFA to reach cost parity with fossil jet fuel in the absence of subsidies or drastic changes in feedstock price.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Ethanol and Sugars (Alcohol-To-Jet)</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.lanzajet.com" target="_blank">LanzaJet</a> developed a process to convert ethanol into SAF by first dehydrating with a catalyst to produce ethylene gas. Ethylene is oligomerized with another catalyst to produce heavier olefins, which are hydrotreated to yield paraffins and isoparaffins. The process was developed to utilize ethanol produced from parent company <a href="https://lanzatech.com" target="_blank">LanzaTech</a>’s microbial gas fermentation, in which carbon monoxide-rich industrial waste gases are used as an energy and food source by special microbes, but it is also applicable to ethanol from standard corn and sugarcane fermentation. Similar chemistry is employed by <a href="https://www.vertimass.com/vertimass-series-c" target="_blank">Vertimass</a> and <a href="https://gevo.com" target="_blank">Gevo</a> to produce SAF, respectively, from ethanol and isobutanol.</p>
							<p>The current market price of ethanol is ~$1.70/gal, which is the <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/ethanol" target="_blank">lowest in 3 years</a> but closer to historical values. A maximum yield of ~0.6 gallons SAF per gallon ethanol is possible based on the chemistry, which suggests a SAF cost lower bound of $2.83/gal. This is lower than HEFA and would seem to be near cost parity with fossil jet fuel, but this neglects any capital or operating costs. Whereas HEFA production is operationally simple, the AtJ process is multistep. Whether U.S. corn ethanol <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14" target="_blank">is even sustainable</a> has also frequently been a contentious question. In fact, the Biden Administration’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-backs-ethanol-industry-low-emission-aviation-fuel-tax-credits-2023-12-15" target="_blank">recent decision to recognize an alternative methodology</a> for calculating lifecycle CO2 emissions may be the only reason AtJ-SPK from corn-ethanol qualifies as SAF and is eligible for IRA credits. Ethanol from sugarcane may be a cheaper and more sustainable route.</p>
							<p>Ethanol fermentation is a very efficient bio-industrial process. The yield is 1 gal ethanol from roughly 6 kg sugar, so a perfect AtJ process beginning from fermentable sugars would require ~10 kg to produce 1 gal SAF. Is it possible to bypass ethanol by genetically engineering microbes that eat sugars but convert them directly into jet-fuel range hydrocarbons rather than ethanol? This was precisely the vision of <a href="https://amyris.com" target="_blank">Amyris</a>, which had aspired to ferment sugar cane directly into jet fuel using its engineered yeast but pivoted from that goal in the mid-2010’s and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amyris-announces-operational-and-financial-restructuring-to-advance-strategic-transformation-301897438.html" target="_blank">announced a restructuring</a> in 2023. Even if some other startup could overcome the challenges and realize that vision, the maximum yield of any such fermentation cannot exceed ~1 gal SAF from 10 kg fermentable sugar, i.e. no higher than an AtJ approach.<sup>[2]</sup> Thus any fermentation-based approach is similarly constrained by the price of fermentable feedstock. The question, then, is whether an engineered microbe could more realistically achieve the maximum yields using lower operational and capital costs than the AtJ catalytic process.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, companies like <a href="https://www.aircompany.com" target="_blank">Air Company</a> and <a href="https://www.liquidwind.se" target="_blank">Liquid Wind</a> are innovating power-to-liquid processes that synthesize AtJ precursors like methanol or ethanol from hydrogen and CO2. Because the economics would be driven by the price of electricity and/or green hydrogen, that discussion is grouped below along with other PtL approaches.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Waste Biomass (Fischer-Tropsch and Others)</p>
							<p>Compared with conventional vegetable oil and sugar/ethanol feedstocks, waste biomass like forest residues are much cheaper, as low as <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/bioenergy-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">$60/ton</a>, and aren’t at risk for a shortage. One approach to using it is gasification and Fischer-Tropsch, as employed by companies like <a href="https://velocys.com/technology" target="_blank">Velocys</a>. The feedstock is gasified by heating to a high temperature, with a low and controlled amount of oxygen and moisture. This produces a gas rich in CO and hydrogen, called synthesis gas (syngas). The H2 content in this gas is typically low, but can be adjusted through the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, where CO and steam react to synthesize H2, though at the expense of losing carbon as CO2. In this way, the syngas can be adjusted to the ideal composition for synthesis of paraffins in the Fischer-Tropsch reactor (H2:CO ratio slightly above 2).</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/sustainable-aviation-fuels/x-05.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">The water gas shift (WGS) reaction enables an increase in the H2:CO ratio of syngas. In a power-to-liquid process, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) can be used to make syngas from CO2 and hydrogen.</p>
							<p>Waste biomass feedstock is cheaper but has lower yields. Only ~0.15–0.2 tons of FT-SPK per ton of feedstock is achievable, so a forest residue price of $60/ton figures to a lower bound for SAF cost at <b>~$1.20/gal</b>. This seems promising, so why haven’t Fischer-Tropsch fuels from waste biomass caught on? One challenge is the high capital costs of the gasifier and Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Both steps benefit from economies of scale, but sourcing enough consistent high-quality feedstock is a challenge. Solid feedstock is not as easy to transport as liquids like cooking oil or ethanol. The $60/ton price tag isn’t necessarily reflective of those collection costs. Plus, waste biomass is hardly pristine. It must be thoroughly dried, and dirt and leaves may cause problems in the gasifier. The raw syngas may require multi-step cleanup to remove contaminants before it is ready for use.</p>

							<p>Sustaining the world’s current population would be impossible without the technologies of the Green Revolution. Advances in plant genetics in the mid-20th century enabled the American agronomist (and Nobel Peace Prize laureate) Norman Borlaug to develop high-yield, disease resistant wheat varieties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution" target="_blank">credited with saving more than a billion people from starvation</a>. Chinese agronomist Yuan Longping’s 1970’s development of the world’s first hybrid rice varieties <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution" target="_blank">saved an additional billion lives</a>. Without the synthetic nitrogen fertilizers enabled by the chemistry of the Haber-Bosch process, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/deadly-dirty-indispensable-the-nitrogen-industry-has-changed-the-world" target="_blank">30-50% of the world’s crops would fail</a>. Productivity increases from mechanized farming equipment have transformed the labor force, enabling modern industrialization; for example, whereas <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/About_NASS/pdf/The%20Story%20of%20U.S.%20Agricultural%20Estimates.pdf" target="_blank">more than 90% of Americans at the founding of the country in 1781 earned their living in agriculture</a>, today only ~1% of US workers are employed in agriculture. Thus, as much as any technological breakthrough, agtech enabled and sustains the modern world.</p>

							<h4>Agriculture’s Urgent Problems and Emerging Breakthrough Solutions</h4>
							<p>Unfortunately, the rapid implementation of these advances resulted in severe unintended consequences. Along with increased yields, agricultural industrialization also intensified environmental pollution from chemical inputs, exacerbated soil erosion due to aggressive farming practices, amplified social inequalities by excluding small-scale farmers, and resulted in unsustainable levels of greenhouse gas emissions. All told, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf" target="_blank">modern industrial agriculture contributes 21-37% of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions</a>. It isn’t news to anyone that our current global warming trajectory, if continued unchecked, will result in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119#sec-3" target="_blank">catastrophic, existential consequences</a>, highlighting the urgent need for more sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
							<p>Modern agriculture is uniquely situated as an industry that relies on stable climate and weather conditions while simultaneously contributing to climate destabilization through greenhouse gas emissions and land-use disturbances. This circumstance sets up a negative feedback loop where agricultural practices aimed at mitigating the short-term effects of global warming on crops result in ever-worsening long-term global warming. For example, inherent inefficiencies in the application of synthetic ammonia-based fertilizers lead to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases" target="_blank">80% of human-caused nitrous oxide emissions</a> (a greenhouse gas 265 times more potent than CO<sub>2</sub>), driving global warming. This <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/SRCCL_Full_Report.pdf" target="_blank">warming drives an increase in extreme weather events</a> such as drought, flood, and wildfire that threaten agricultural productivity, leading to a need for more ammonia-based fertilizers to offset losses – further increasing warming. Similar feedback loops are set up by the use of synthetic pesticides breeding pesticide-resistant pests, soil erosion and compaction due to mechanized farm practices, increased drought threats due to mismanagement of irrigation, and on and on.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/venture-agtech/x-02.webp">
							<p>Clearly, we need to find a way to break out of this vicious cycle. A Penn State study estimates that <a href="https://www.futurity.org/food-production-2050-1368582-2" target="_blank">food production needs to increase by as much as 68% by 2050</a> to feed our growing global population. If agriculture continues on the same trajectory, the only way to get there is through an increased application of the sproblems. We’ll examine the emerging technological solutions to the following critical issues and our investment outlook in those areas:</p>
							<ul class="takeaways">
								<li>Direct ag contributions to the climate crisis</li>
								<li>Soil quality deterioration threatening yields</li>
								<li>Pesticide resistance</li>
							</ul>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/venture-agtech/x-06.webp">
							<div class="chapter-anchor" id="problem-1"></div>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Problem 1: Agriculture’s Contribution to the Climate Crisis</p>
							<p>As described above, modern ag practices are significant contributors to the climate crisis. Two technological innovations that are poised to make direct improvements here in the near term are green ammonia and phosphate.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Solution 1: Green Ammonia</p>
							<p>Developing an alternative to Haber-Bosch-derived nitrogen fertilizers is an urgent need, because these fertilizers are a potent source of pollution and ecological damage, masease of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. In addition, the production of synthetic fertilizers is unsustainable; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00698-w" target="_blank">nitrogen fertilizer production uses ~2% of global fossil fuels and contributes more than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually</a>.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/venture-agtech/x-04.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">Soil depletion as a result of synthetic fertilizer application has reduced yields per amount of fertilizer applied worldwide since the advent of the green revolution. Source: <a href="https://www.iatp.org/new-research-chemical-fertilisers" target="_blank">IATP</a></p>
							<p>Improving upon the carbon-intensive Haber-Bosch process (which has supplied the world’s nitrogen fertilizers for the last century) is no small feat, but promising scientific innovations have brought that goal into the realm of sts, with a successful pilot at a Reykjavík biogas plant achieving up to 100% conversion rates. Jupiter Ionics has a similar electrochemical process based on the MacFarlane Simonov Ammonia Cell, which uses renewable electricity to convert air and water directly into green ammonia, carrying the promise of simpler, more sustainable nitrogen fertilizer production.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Solution 2: Green Phosphate</p>
							<p>A similar opportunity exists for phosphate, another key farm input. Unlike nitrogen, which can be directly harvested from the air indefinitely, phosphorus is a thoroughly non-renewable resource; <a href="https://energyindustryreview.com/metals-mining/phosphorus-a-critical-environmental-challenge" target="_blank">it’s estimated that the world has only 400 years of phosphorus left <i>total</i></a>, if used at current rates (presumably, humans of the 2400s will still need to eat, so this of course presents a major problem). <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-desert-rock-that-feeds-the-world/508853" target="_blank">Seventy percent of global phosphorus rock sources exist in Morocco</a>, where uncertain geopolitics contribute to volatility in phosphorus markets that impact farmers worldwide. Yet using current methods, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301200878_The_Nature_and_Properties_of_Soils_15th_edition" target="_blank">~90% of phosphorus applied to fields is lost</a>, mostly from reacting with other soil chemicals to create compounds that plants are unable to metabolize (and phosphorus runoff from soils is also a driver of harmful algal blooms).</p>
							<p>The most likely solutions to the dwindling world phosphate supply center around using phosphate more efficiently. <a href="https://www.phospholutions.com" target="_blank">Phospholutions</a>, using technology originally invented at Penn State University, has developed a chemistry-driven solution which integrates proprietary metal oxide-based materials into the upstream production process for conventional fertilizers to regulate phosphate release in the soil, ensuring a more consistent availability for plant uptake throughout the entire growing season. This innovation is aimed at making phosphorus more bioavailable and minimizing tie-up, reducing the amount of fertilizer applied to fields and therefore reducing costs for farmers and phosphate waste and runoff. The company’s soil chemistry approach is crop and geography agnostic, presenting a promising platform for a $70B global market.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Investment Outlook: Farm Inputs</p>
							<p>The market for chemical fertilizers is approximately ~$200 billion in 2023 globally and generates massive negative externalities, so there’s a great opportunity for doing well through doing good here. Though current practices are thoroughly unsustainable, supplanting “business as usual” here at scale is going to be a difficult prospect becauss the better. Some of the companies discussed in this section benefit from the possibility of shrinking production facilities and enabling more localized production, which is a promising avenue for cutting e.g., shipping and carbon costs.</p>
							<div class="chapter-anchor" id="problem-2"></div>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Problem 2: Soil Degradation Threatening Yields</p>
							<p>Soil doesn’t get its due respect. Far from inert matter, soil can be thought of as a living, breathing organism, and the plants it fosters contribute to the soil’s health as much as the soil provides nutrients for the plants. Like other thins losing its ability to cycle nutrients and support plant growth (turning into lifeless dirt). In turn, without the preparation of key nutrients provided by the soil microbiome, plants would be unable to grow.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, modern industrial agriculture treats soil in many ways like another outdated piece of farm equipment. Why nurture soils that can recycle key nutrients at a stable, steady rate when those same chemicals can be pseauing of yields despite increasing chemical fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide inputs</a>.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Solution 1: Carbon Markets: Subsidizing Regenerative Agriculture Using Farm Data</p>
							<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_agriculture" target="_blank">Regenerative agriculture</a>” is a term for a set of sustainable agricultural practices aimed in part at restoring soils to their pre-Green Revolsce to prevent erosion). Restoring soil health can have an outsize positive environmental impact, besio State soil scientist Dr. Rattan Lal calculated that if universally applied, <a href="https://www.climateandcapitalmedia.com/regenerative-agriculture-the-business-that-could-offset-all-human-emissions" target="_blank">regen ag practices could reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by 157 parts per million (ppm) by 2100</a>, exceeding the Paris Climate agreement’s goal of reducing current CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by 75 ppm.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, regenerative agriculture practices are typically more costly than current industrial agriculture practices, so economic ins carbon measurements with higher data fidelis how best to implement regen ag practices. The companswhile reducing resource usage. This approach, coupled with day-to-day weather-responsive updates and a robust database of potential farm solutions, simplifies regen ag onboarding and offers farmers meaningful interaction with their data.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Solution 2: Restoring and Enhancing the Soil Microbiome</p>
							<p>Biofertilizers are living organisms with the ability to provide essential nutrients to plants through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, or other mechanisms that enhance plant growth and soil fertility. Similarly, biostimulants are substances or microorganisms that, when applied to plants or the soil, enhance nutrient efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, and crop quality, without being directly involved in providing essential nutrients. Companies developing <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/106802-02/company/profile#insights" target="_blank">biofertilizers</a> and <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/99446-23/company/profile" target="_blank">biostimulants</a> have enjoyed massive interest and high valuations in recent years. However, <a href="https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2023/05/03/university-research-casts-skepticism" target="_blank">recent data</a> has called into question the efficacy of what could be considered “generation 1” biofertilizer solutions which typically apply just one microorganism to e.g. seeds, where it isecreted sugars and is compatible with gram-negative bacteria-associated crops like corn, wheat and soy. Such biostimulant approaches are also compatible with carbon markets, though how to quantify carbon drawdown by such techniques is an open question.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Investment Outlook: Soil Data and Biostimulants</p>
							<p>The investment outlook for biostimulants, biofertilizers, and carbon sequestration appears promising, albeit bundled with uncertainties related to the political csstood sials to help farmers get comfort that a product will work on their farm. Navigating this regulatory and commercial process is challenging and time consuming and may require several rounds of financing before a company begins generating significant revenue.</p>
							<div class="chapter-anchor" id="problem-3"></div>
							<p class="subheading uppercase">Problem 3: Pesticide Resistance</p>
							<p>A fundamental problem with using pesticides is the potential for pathogens to evolve resistance to those methods. The escalating issue of such resistance is casting a grim shadow sd biodiversity given the pivotal role these agrochemicals play in contemporary crop protection.</p>
							<img class="images" src="/img/ideas/thoughtpaper/venture-agtech/x-05.webp">
							<p class="small-caption">A representative plot of growing pesticide resistance; here, the number of herbicide-resistant weeds is shown over time. Similar plots exist for insecticide, fungicide, and antibiotic resistance. Source: <a href="https://www.weedscience.org/Pages/ChronologicalIncrease.aspx" target="_blank">The International Herbicide-Resistant Weed Database</a></p>
							<p class="subheading">Solution 1: Pesticide Resistance Solution: New Modes of Action</p>
							<p>The conventional strategy to circumvent resistance to a given pesticide is s a chemical for which resistance has yet tossd along the same lines involves using breakthrough science to package traditional pesticides in a new way that pests have never encountered. The company <a href="https://www.invaio.com" target="_blank">Invaio</a> employs a novel synthetic biology platform to produce biologics from microbial-derived particles then envelops them in a protective membrane, thus adding resilience against field degradation, a significant challenge impacting the broader adoption of biologicals in the field. In a holistsms informed by a proprietary predictive AI platform to evolve (among other things) pathogen-fighting bacteria.</p>
							<p class="subheading">Investment Outlook: Resistant Pathogens</p>
							<p>While there is an abundance of innovation in this space, there are significant hurdles to cross before these solutiso obtain regulatory approval is laborious, slow and costly. As with biofertilizers and biostimulants, this slow regulatory and commercial adoption process is a challenge for venture funds with a 10-year investment horizon.</p>
