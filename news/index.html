						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91277425/boom-supersonic-flight-plane-design" target="_blank">Boom Supersonic flew a supersonic flight over the Mojave Desert, in California, using a radically different approach that was theorized decades ago but only now has been possible thanks to new engines and computers. The testing of its Boomless Cruise technology—recorded with a sophisticated microphone array by NASA—showed that its XB-1 demonstrator aircraft broke the sound barrier three times without generating a sonic boom that reached the ground. This is the first time a plane has achieved this.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/travel/boom-supersonic-first-flight-break-sound-barrier-mach-1" target="_blank">The return of supersonic travel has been remarkably slow for something faster than the speed of sound, but a major milestone was achieved when Boom Supersonic completed its first supersonic flight. Boom, the American company building what promises to be the world’s fastest airliner, broke the sound barrier for its first time with a test flight in Mojave, California. The company’s XB-1 demonstrator aircraft’s supersonic flight is the first time an independently developed jet has broken the sound barrier.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a63120790/ram-rotor-detonation-engine" target="_blank">Engineers have investigated ways to harness the chaotic power of explosions into an engine that can push past speeds far beyond the comparatively slow realm of conventional chemical combustion. These are known as detonation engines, they come in all types of designs—including pulse detonation engines, oblique detonation engines, and rotating detonation engines—and they each have their own quirks with regards to how they achieve this perilous-yet-powerful propulsion. Recently, rotating detonation engines (RDEs) have started to show some promise. In fact, earlier this year, Venus Aerospace achieved one of the longest sustained tests of its own RDE. This engine combusts its fuel and oxidizer in a rotating ring-shaped channel, and the resulting shockwaves create a sustained combustion reaction that makes the engine more efficient than conventional rockets.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://wwd.com/home-design/furniture/mycoworks-reishi-launch-first-furniture-1236760477" target="_blank">Just over a year after Mycoworks’ Reishi, a new material grown from mycelium, debuted its first full fashion look at the Buro Stedelijk museum space in Amsterdam, it’s ready to take on the world of interiors. The first furniture pieces covered in Reishi are being made by the French family-run firm Ligne Roset and will hit the market in 2025. Mycoworks has been working with Ligne Roset for the past five years. The collaboration has tested Reishi’s performance on an industrial level to understand if it will one day be able to meet market demands. Among those tests was putting 220 pounds in weight on top of a chair cushion made of Reishi and repeating that test 20,000 times.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-18/boston-area-commonwealth-fusion-aims-to-turn-coal-plants-into-nukes" target="_blank">Commonwealth Fusion has crossed a key threshold on its quest to generate clean power. It’s eyeing shuttered fossil-fuel plants as prime sites to do so. The company is so confident in its fusion technology that it’s evaluating old coal and natural gas plants as locations to build its first commercial system even before its demonstration device is finished. Doing so would mark a step change for the energy transition and the shift from polluting fossil fuels to carbon-free fusion power, though fusion remains an unproven nuclear technology.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boom-track-fly-supersonic-after-eighth-flight-test-concorde-2024-11" target="_blank">The return of supersonic commercial flights just got another step closer to reality. Boom Supersonic announced Saturday that its eighth test flight reached a new maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. It matched the previous test’s top speed of Mach 0.82 — slightly faster than the cruising speed of a Boeing 737. The test focused on showing the aircraft is still controllable at higher speeds without its stability augmentation system.</a>

The company’s XB-1 demonstrator aircraft recently completed its eighth flight, setting a new altitude record and matching its top speed. This milestone is part of Boom’s ongoing effort to reintroduce supersonic flights, a concept that faded after the Concorde’s final flight in 2003 due to high costs and noise concerns.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://time.com/7094811/energy-vault-evx" target="_blank">Solar and wind energy are renewable, but rely on the weather. Energy Vault’s EVx Gravity Energy Storage System instead employs massive blocks, which, after being raised, store the energy that went into lifting them, and when lowered, release that energy when it’s needed. The ever-present pull of gravity amounts to a natural battery that can provide short-, medium-, or long-term storage. It's resilient to harsh weather conditions and high temperatures, and since the energy is produced inside the structure, there is no risk of chemical fires.</a>

In fact, UScellular is working with Tarana Wireless to increase its FWA capacity in West Plains, Missouri, a town where the demand for FWA is high. So high that the carrier has been getting such good uptake of its fixed wireless that it was about to run out of capacity on its mobile network.</a>

That’s why NASA is paying Nokia to network astronauts headed for the moon. Axiom, NASA’s space suit contractor, said last week that it will use Nokia’s tech as the primary comms system for AxEMU space suits that astronauts will wear during the Artemis III landing (assuming that happens on schedule.) To fund the communications upgrade, NASA added $57.5 million to Axiom’s suit task order, which is now valued at $285.5 million.</a>

Paradromics is building a brain-computer interface, or a BCI, called the Connexus Direct Data Interface. Paradromics’ system will initially serve as an assistive communication device that can turn brain signals into outputs like text or synthesized speech. This means patients with severe paralysis could eventually use it to regain their ability to communicate. </a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.inc.com/chloe-aiello/venus-aerospace-ceo-sassie-duggleby-building-time-machine-across-world-home-for-dinner.html" target="_blank">Sarah “Sassie” Duggleby wants to build a time machine. And her Houston-based company Venus Aerospace is working on a hypersonic engine that's about as close as it gets. The hypersonic engine in Venus’s Stargazer aircraft is designed to travel up to Mach 9 speeds, making it more akin to “a slow-flying rocket as opposed to a fast-flying jet” Duggleby says. The Concorde, by comparison–which still holds the record as the fastest passenger plane to cross the Atlantic–flew at Mach 2 speeds.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/see-boom-jet-used-test-worlds-next-supersonic-airliner-2024-3" target="_blank">Colorado aerospace company Boom Supersonic wants to bring back the era of the Concorde — a beloved faster-than-sound passenger jet that flew for nearly 30 years before retiring in 2003. Boom’s vision of the next supersonic airliner is a Mach 1.7 plane called the Overture, and the company just flew its first prototype. Nicknamed the “baby boom,” the XB-1 demonstrator is the “foundation” for the futuristic Overture. Boom says it uses the experimental plane to prove innovative technologies key to safe and efficient supersonic flight.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91030570/lyten-most-innovative-companies-2024" target="_blank">Graphene was invented in 2004, and Lyten is now leading efforts to use it to build cleaner, lighter, and more powerful lithium-sulfur batteries. Using a “scaffold” of 3D graphene within the electrolyte to tame the typically unruly lithium-sulfur combination, Lyten’s batteries avoid the need for nickel, manganese, cobalt, and graphite. They offer dramatic efficiency gains over their lithium-ion counterparts—not to mention environmental and ethical improvements. These will be critical for electric vehicles, drones, satellites, and other energy-intensive devices, like eVTOL aircraft.</a>

The 8-foot-long vehicle was dropped from an Aero L-29 Delfín aircraft at 12,000 feet and flew under the power of a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant engine. This engine was not fired at full thrust because the location of the test flight, an unspecified range in the United States, did not permit flight faster than the speed of sound.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkobayashisolomon/2023/12/20/energy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china" target="_blank">Energy Vault (NYSE: NRGV) will license six additional EVx gravity energy storage systems in China just months after starting the commissioning of the world’s first GESS facility near Shanghai. Energy Vault installations use excess renewable energy to lift massive composite blocks; then, when the energy is once again needed on the grid, the blocks are dropped and the kinetic energy from the dropping blocks spins generators that supply electricity to the grid. The company believes it will be able to achieve a respectable round-trip efficiency (RTE) of over 80% with its current design.</a>

Last winter, beekeepers in the US lost around half of their hives. Dalan Animal Health is focused on one challenge—a highly contagious disease called foulbrood that threatens bees worldwide. The company developed the first-ever vaccine for bees, which is given to a queen bee to pass on to her offspring. After nabbing a conditional license from the FDA in late 2022, Dalan started piloting the vaccine with thousands of hives.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/commonwealth-fusion-systems-tour-and-ceo-interview.html" target="_blank">A fusion power plant has been, so far, firmly rooted in the realm of science fiction. Commonwealth is trying to change that, and has raised more than $2 billion in venture capital from the likes of Bill Gates, Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Google, John Doerr, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and more. That’s more private capital than any other fusion startup, according to the Fusion Industry Association, the industry’s trade group.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90912014/boom-supersonic-partners-and-engine-details" target="_blank">It can take a long, steady ground roll to get a big airplane up to speed, and for Boom Supersonic, the path off the runway is starting to look a little clearer. At the Paris Auto Show this week, the aerospace startup announced a slew of partners for the construction of major components of its aircraft, marking another significant step towards its goal of bringing supersonic air travel to the masses—or, at least, the wealthiest subset of the masses.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://qz.com/hubble-telescope-needs-a-life-space-x-nasa-1850433202" target="_blank">NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, and in the decades since scientists have benefitted from its unprecedented views far beyond our galaxy. But Earth’s gravity and atmosphere will inevitably pull the bus-sized telescope back to the planet, perhaps as soon as 2028. NASA will need to safely bring it back down to crash into the Pacific Ocean, or better yet: lift it into a higher orbit so it can continue its mission, which has already cost the US about $16 billion since the idea for the telescope was conceived in 1977. Astroscale and Momentus want to use a robot to raise the telescope to a higher orbit.</a>
