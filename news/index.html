						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supersonic-commercial-air-travel-60-minutes-2021-11-21" target="_blank">The last commercial supersonic flight was almost 20 years ago, and even then super-fast flights were only on very limited routes. Most of today’s jetliners actually fly more slowly than they did 20 or 30 years ago, in order to save fuel. But that may be about to change. It’s still a long shot, but private start-up companies – with a big assist from NASA – may just give us all another chance to fly faster than the speed of sound.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/floating-city-united-nations-south-korea-2021-11" target="_blank">More than two years ago, a group of builders, engineers, and architects crowded around a table at the United Nations to discuss an ambitious concept: a floating city that could withstand natural disasters, including floods, tsunamis, and Category 5 hurricanes. The UN-backed project cleared that hurdle when the city of Busan, South Korea, agreed to host a floating city in collaboration with the project’s designer, OCEANIX, and the UN Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat). Like many coastal cities, Busan is threatened by rising sea levels.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/cognixion-raises-12m-to-build-its-brain-monitoring-headset-for-people-with-disabilities" target="_blank">Cognixion, a startup designing an intuitive brain-monitoring headset and interface for people with physical disabilities, has raised a $12M A round to pursue its accessibility ambitions. Armed with this funding, it should be able to complete the long list of requirements necessary for any medical or assistive device to be made widely available. The company makes a headset that uses electroencephalography to detect certain patterns of brain activity, which are then used to guide a cursor and navigate a full-featured interface. It uses an iPhone as its own “brain” and for a display, and connects to accessories like speakers and accessibility devices so that the user can do everything they need to in a single UI.</a>

Hot on the heels from the $10 million round Spartan Radar announced in August, the company today announced it snagged another $15 million from investors led by Prime Movers Lab.

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90685356/this-startup-is-reinventing-co2-capture-to-reduce-the-costs" target="_blank">Direct air capture—technology designed to suck CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere—could be a critical tool in fighting climate change. Climate models, including the one used by the IPCC, show decarbonizing society won’t be enough; we’ll also need huge capacity for “negative emissions” to reach climate goals. But at the moment, direct air capture is too expensive to be a valuable tool. One direct air capture startup, called CarbonCapture, wants to help bring costs down by changing a key material used in the technology.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/space-perspective-raises-40m-series-a-for-stratospheric-balloon-rides" target="_blank">Instead of going to space on a rocket, which are prohibitively expensive to develop and may not appeal to all customers, the startup plans to offer rides to the stratosphere using a capsule attached to a large balloon. Its plans have attracted investor interest: the company said it had raised a $40 million Series A to take it through to its first planned commercial flights in late 2024. Space Perspective has already collected 475 reservations, each of which was secured by a deposit between $10,000-$25,000, depending on how soon the passenger is looking to fly. The total cost of a seat is $125,000.</a>

The seed round is led by Prime Movers Lab and Alpaca VC and features a slew of additional firms, including Dolby Family Ventures, Calm Ventures, Gaingels, Towerview Ventures, GFA Venture Partners and Suffolk Construction. The startup looks to put a slew of key emerging technologies to work in service of building houses with fewer workers in a significantly truncated time frame. Diamond Age claims that when, fully realized, its tech will be able to reduce manual human labor by 55% and shrink the construction time on a single family home from nine months to 30 days. Part of this funding will go toward putting the processes in place to construct a 1,100-square-foot “demonstration house” as proof of concept.</a>

The Boom Overture is expected to fly 65 passengers from New York to London in just over three-and-one-half hours, Newark to Frankfurt in four hours and, eventually, San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours. Boom is building a 1/3 scale prototype of the aircraft and hopes to begin test flights next year. It also plans to break ground for a factory for the Overture in 2022, with planes rolling off the assembly line in 2025, followed by the first passenger flights in 2029.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/pyka-shows-off-its-new-electric-passenger-plane-the-p3" target="_blank">Pyka appeared out of nowhere in 2019 with an unusual take on electric aircraft: a pilotless crop duster. The success of this first plane led the company to begin developing its next one, the P3: a nine-passenger craft with a totally unique propeller setup aimed at making regional flights cheaper and simpler. It could be flying as soon as next year. The company also has a new president in Dan Grossman, formerly of Zipcar, Ford and Maven. The transportation sector DNA he brings could help Pyka create the networks and partnerships it needs to get off the ground in local air travel.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/neuralink-competitor-raises-20-million-for-brain-implants" target="_blank">A competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink said it raised $20 million, enough to get it on track to introduce a new generation of powerful and tiny electrodes to the human brain. Paradromics Inc., founded in 2015 about a year ahead of Neuralink, is building brain-computer interfaces that could help people with disorders ranging from paralysis to speech impediments. “Once you start to realize that the best way to describe the brain is through data, you start to reframe a lot of classically hard-to-treat conditions,” said Matt Angle, CEO of Paradromics. “What the brain really is—it’s a data system.” For example, where a biological approach to blindness might be to attempt to regrow the retina, his approach would be to get visual data to the right part of the brain, even if it means using a computer.</a>

I believe hydrogen to be the world’s best candidate to solve what Bill Gates calls “The 75% Problem”: three-fourths of all emissions are related to agricultural, industrial, and other hard-to-decarbonize processes. High heat and cheap electricity produced using Heliogen’s innovative AI-powered concentrated solar power (CSP) arrays provide the energy that allows Bloom’s highly efficient solid oxide electrolyzers to produce hydrogen at very low cost.</a>

Cybersecurity executive and former U.S. Army officer Phyllis Newhouse and venture capitalist Isabelle Freidheim are the SPAC’s CEO and board chair, respectively. Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is one of its advisers. Based in Pasadena, Calif., Heliogen has been testing its technology in a demonstration facility since 2019. It now hopes to scale operations to bring down costs and emissions in energy-intensive industries like mining, Mr. Gross said in an interview.</a>

And maybe—if it’s a very special balloon—it will reach the stratosphere. That’s the simple, underlying idea behind the latest space travel venture. Space Perspective aims to use giant “space balloons” to bring eight people at a time to a 19-mile-high (30.6-km-high), pitch-black lookout for $125,000 views of the planet Earth. Its tourist flights go on sale on June 23, after a private pre-sale period that has already sold out at least three initial trips—all slated for takeoff in 2024.</a>

Gekko, and more. The money will be used both to continue development of the “Sunlight Refinery,” as Heliogen calls it, and deploy some actual on-site installations that would work in real production workflows at scale.</a>

In the face of these news, our civilization’s only concerted response seems to be the production of yet more glossy, carefully written, multi-hundred-page reports warning of imminent danger. The tide turned today, as Heliogen, founded by Idealab’s Bill Gross, announced that it had raised $83 million in an oversubscribed funding round. The new investment, added to a previous $25 million round, totals $108 million of institutional investment into Heliogen’s concentrated solar power (CSP) technology.</a>

The carrier announced it’s buying 15 planes from Boom Supersonic with the option to purchase 35 more at some point. Boom’s first commercial supersonic jet, the Overture, has not been built or certified yet. It is targeting the start of passenger service in 2029 with a plane that could fly at Mach 1.7 and cut some flight times in half. That means a flight from New York to London that typically lasts seven hours would only take 3½ hours.</a>

After reaching cruising altitude, the pilot hits the rocket boosters and blasts the aircraft to the edge of space at more than 9,000 mph, or about 12 times the speed of sound. The plane travels at that speed for about 15 minutes, then glides against the atmosphere to slow itself down, cruising back to Earth to land at a conventional airport. Venus is aiming to use this technique to ferry people from Los Angeles to Tokyo in about an hour.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/tarana-takes-a-292-million-swing-at-building-wireless-broadband-to-rival-fiber" target="_blank">Tarana Wireless is working on a novel approach to direct wireless signals around obstacles. With sufficient computing power and the right algorithms, Tarana’s antennas can send multiple signals to each customer, rapidly hop among the best-performing connections for each one, and combine them to strengthen the signal. Tarana’s service can reach speeds of about 800 megabits per second, depending on how far customers are from the antenna and how many people are using each one, which is much faster than satellite internet.</a>

Heliogen says this will be the first concentrated solar technology used to power a mine in the United States, and perhaps the world. Heliogen will use artificial intelligence and an array of 40,000 computer-vision-controlled mirrors to harness the power of the sun, almost like a smart magnifying glass. The first system at Rio Tinto will be the size of about 100 footfall fields.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://longevity.technology/prime-movers-lab-longevity-is-clearly-our-interest" target="_blank">At the end of last year, Elevian’s $15 million funding caught the eye of many – in part because of the involvement of US venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab, which has since announced raising a whopping $245 million for its second early-stage investment fund. Prime Movers’ new fund is intended for investments in “breakthrough scientific start-ups” across a wide range of sectors, but the Elevian funding indicates one of those sectors is clearly longevity. We recently spoke with Dr Caleb Bell, one of the firm’s newest partners, about why the longevity opportunity excites him.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/archer-united-airlines-spac-air-taxi" target="_blank">Less than a year after coming out of stealth, Archer Aviation has struck a deal to go public in a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition vehicle — and it’s also won a $1 billion order for up to 200 its yet-to-fly aircraft from United Airlines, in the first step by an airline into urban air mobility. Archer has agreed to merge with Atlas Crest Investment Corp., a $500 million SPAC. United is also investing an undisclosed amount in an accompanying PIPE offering that will raise $600 million, resulting in $1.1 billion in funding for Archer, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, with a valuation of $3.8 billion.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-space-economy-is-for-real-heres-how-we-know-51612978424" target="_blank">Alpha Insights, a small company with newly acquired satellite technology, is raising money to invest in the space industry. That might seem like a blip on the radar compared with the likes of SpaceX and its successful NASA launches, but it’s actually a very big deal. Space applications have been proliferating as launch costs keep falling. That should generate the sales and growth required to get space-stocks moving higher for years.</a>

Archer said it will take the wraps off of its aircraft early this year, but production won’t start until 2023. The company said its first aircraft will be able to travel as far as 60 miles at 150 miles an hour. Fiat Chrysler has already collaborated on the design of the cockpit.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://youtu.be/IfoQW6Xqy6Q" target="_blank">It would be easy to believe that we as a society are headed in a negative direction, to be fearful of the future – but as Tony says, Fear is simply imagination undirected. What happens when you give direction to your imagination? That’s what we call faith. Faith is not learned, it’s something we are born with. Faith is what fuels us through times of fear and uncertainty. It is more powerful than any emotion, even fear. When all hell is breaking loose, it gives us the ability to find our center, to help ourselves and others to find answers, to find a higher meaning in the midst of our pain and in spite of our fear. And if you’re a leader, you take that certainty and transfer it into others, because human conviction has a viral effect and will spread.</a>

Vessels handling this essential task are known as space tugs, the "tow trucks" of outer space. Founded in 2017 by Russian immigrant Mikhail Kokorich and launched from the Y Combinator start-up program, space tug company Momentus has partnered with SpaceX and counts NASA and Lockheed Martin as early customers.

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393547-want-spacex-stock-momentus-may-be-closest-thing" target="_blank">Space is the ultimate fantasy and final frontier. That includes for investing. There’s major thirst for this sector, which is yet to be created. For space pure plays, there’s almost nothing in the public markets. Even in the private secondary market, it’s nearly impossible to get shares in the granddaddy of them all; SpaceX. While you can’t buy SpaceX, you soon may be able to buy one of their customers; Momentus. They call themselves "the space infrastructure company" and one could argue they will be the first pure play space company in the public markets.</a>

The company, with about 15 employees currently, will use the funding to continue development of Spaceship Neptune, a stratospheric balloon system designed to carry people to an altitude of 30 kilometers. Such flights would give people an experience similar to some aspects of spaceflight, notably the view.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/momentus-wins-a-moon-order-as-space-economy-heats-up-51606759263" target="_blank">The space logistics company Momentus—a rare, publicly traded pure- play space investment—has signed up a customer for lunar missions in a deal that helps validate its strategy and appears to be another first for commercial companies in space. Momentus has signed an agreement with Canadensys Aerospace to deliver a 50-kilogram spacecraft to low lunar orbit in 2023 or 2024. Moon missions are usually the domain of national space agencies, such as NASA. Momentus doesn’t have, or plan to build, its own capability to launch rockets from Earth like SpaceX and its competitor Blue Origin do. Instead, the company wants to be the last-mile delivery option in space—or, in the case of the moon, the last 240,000 miles.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-covaxx-idUSKBN28526F" target="_blank">COVAXX, a unit of United Biomedical Inc, said it has received purchase commitments totaling $2.8 billion to deliver more than 140 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries, including Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. The multitope peptide-based vaccine is currently in early-stage trials in Taiwan, lagging some of the frontrunners in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine. The U.S.-based company signed an agreement in September with Brazilian lab and hospital group DASA S.A. to conduct mid-to-late stage trials in Brazil for the vaccine. COVAXX estimates it can produce 100 million doses in first half of next year and 1 billion by end of 2021.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2020/5911422/heliogens-helioheat" target="_blank">Creating the tons of steel and concrete we use to build our world requires a massive amount of heat—and most of it comes from burning dirty fossil fuels. HelioHeat cleans up that process by using the power of the sun. Here’s how it works: A field of 100,000 motorized, computer-controlled mirrors concentrates sunlight in the direction of a 40-m-tall tower, “like a giant magnifying glass,” says Heliogen founder Bill Gross. There, a hot spot gets up to 2,000°F, where the heat can be harnessed to melt steel or make cement or electricity. Future iterations of the tech, says Gross, could use the sunlight to create hydrogen to power zero-emission automobiles.</a>

SpaceX believes that its gigantic Starship reusable spacecraft (still under development), which is designed to be refueled in space, can fill this need. But the company is also partnering with privately held Momentus (which will soon be publicly traded after merging into Stable Road Acquisition Corp (SRAC)) to tow satellites, carried to orbit by SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, into their final orbits.</a>

Heliogen will commit $31.1 million to the project, the DOE announced November 12. The project will include a newly-built heliostat field and act as a demonstration plant for the integrated sCO2 power cycle and storage system. The plant will limit the turbine inlet temperature to 600° C in order to use widely-available stainless steel alloys.</a>

However, there is a space-logistics franchise named Momentus, with ties to SpaceX, that is set to go public in coming months through a merger with special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, Stable Road Acquisition (SRAC). Momentus won’t launch rockets into space. But it will leverage lower launch costs to offer space services to others. It plans to be the first provider of hub-and-spoke space infrastructure as well as last-mile space delivery.</a>

With climate change bearing down ever more insistently on the human species, one big problem the world must fix is cutting the cost of clean energy to supply heat to the industries with over 20% of all greenhouse emissions like cement, steel, fertilizer and hydrogen that now depend on fossil energy for heat.</a>

However, its first steps to get there have taken the company far away from the pack, first to New Zealand and now to banana plantations in Costa Rica and Ecuador, where it’s preparing to field a robotic crop-spraying airplane called Pelican that CEO Michael Norcia says will prove out technology he believes will lead the way to an era of green, low-cost passenger planes.</a>

He’s hoping to be right a second time in staking his money and reputation on green energy. The pandemic, by decimating oil demand, crashing prices and challenging the economics of some fossil-fuel projects, has accelerated some industry moves toward low-carbon energy. In Mr. Gross’s view, it has also leveled the playing field for green energy’s drive to displace fossil fuels.</a>

Fred Kennedy became president of Momentus effective this week and his most recent roles were as inaugural director of the U.S. Department of Defense's Space Development Agency (SDA), and before that head of the Tactical Technology Office for DARPA. Bringing Kennedy on board could help the company get a hold of lucrative military contracts, due to the new president’s contacts, allowing Momentus a potential anchor customer to attract other clients to the fold.</a>

COVAXX has launched a Phase I trial of UB-612 in Taiwan, with a U.S. Phase I trial and a readout of data in non-human primates planned this fall. Last week, COVAXX said it will advance UB-612 into a Phase II/III trial in Brazil, through a collaboration with that country’s largest diagnostic medicine company, DASA and vaccine distributor Mafra.</a>

To keep better track of storms, NASA and startup Momentus announced a service agreement to launch a pathfinder satellite in less than a year. The agreement will see Momentus transport the TROPICS Pathfinder CubeSat to low Earth orbit no later than June 30, 2021. This mission is supposed to test out technologies and reduce risk ahead of launching the larger TROPICS constellation mission of six CubeSats, which could enter service in the next couple of years.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/31/health/prosthetic-unlimited-tomorrow-robotics-scn-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Ten years ago, Easton LaChappelle was a teen watching YouTube videos in his Colorado bedroom on how to build robot arms from LEGOs. Today, he's the founder of Unlimited Tomorrow, a company that designs low-cost, 3D printed prosthetic limbs that can be operated with the mind. It was a chance encounter in the eighth grade that set him on the path to entrepreneurship. At a science fair, he met a 7-year-old girl who had an $80,000 prosthetic arm that he described as "archaic" and offered very little help with her physical needs.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/truelimb-robotic-arms-look-real-and-cost-less-than-traditional-prosthetics" target="_blank">Unlimited Tomorrow recently started taking orders for TrueLimb, its customized, 3D-printed robotic arm. TrueLimb candidates scan their limbs using a 3D-scanner at home with the help of a friend or family member. Traditionally, getting fit for a prosthetic requires working with a prosthetist, which can drive up the cost. A traditional device can cost up to $80,000. TrueLimb costs $8,000, largely because there's no middleman involved.</a>

It's science and—especially during a pandemic—logistics. The coronavirus crisis has led to a veritable gold rush in the biopharmaceutical industry. One company thinks it has a major advantage in that particular race: manufacturing. COVAXX, a spinout of companies within the biotech firms United Biomedical and United Neuroscience, tells Fortune that its specific technology can give it a leg up over the dozens of larger companies in the necessary aspect of delivering a vaccine to people on time.</a>

For the first time in human history, we are not merely exploring a new landmass. We, as a biological species, are advancing to a new element — the cosmos. The whole history of humanity is the story of our struggle with space and time. Mastering new horizons, moving ever farther; driven by the desire for a better life or for profit, out of fear or out of sheer curiosity, people found ever faster, easier, cheaper and safer ways to conquer the space between here and there.</a>

Which is striking, given that he’s Russian. Crew Dragon was conceived and constructed by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s space-transport company. “It’s remarkable,” Mr. Kokorich, a physicist and aerospace engineer, says of the mission, “because it marks the transition of space exploration from the nation-state into the hands of private entrepreneurs.”</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://medium.com/prime-movers-lab/investing-in-upward-farms-vertical-farming-2-0-391c182355de" target="_blank">Prime Movers Lab recently led a financing for Upward Farms. Upward Farms is an aquaponic indoor vertical farm producing microgreens and baby greens with a path at scale to be below the cost of conventional farming “in the field“. That is what is really exciting here. A lot of money has gone into vertical farming 1.0 — the potential for the industry is there, but production costs remain unsustainably high. One of the things that really sets us apart at Prime Movers Lab is not only our focus on deep scientific breakthroughs but our emphasis on at scale unit economics.</a>

Momentus, a Santa Clara, California-based company, has so far struck $40 million worth of customer contracts this year and announced on Thursday its latest deal with Dutch small satellite specialist ISILaunch. Its the eighth such deal Momentus has unveiled in 2020, with the company providing its orbit transfer services for ISILaunch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch in December.</a>

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants only account for 25% of total, and electrical generation is one source of GHG emissions for which cheap renewable sources are well-suited. If we don’t radically reduce the remaining 75% of emissions, we could carpet Arizona in wall-to-wall photovoltaic (PV) panels and still not do enough to bring down atmospheric CO2 levels.</a>

COVAXX is a subsidiary of United Biomedical. Dr. Steven Hinrichs, Chairman of UNMC’s Pathology and Microbiology Department, said antibody testing relies on blood samples to determine whether a person has had an immune response to COVID-19, rather than detect if the virus is present. He said the tests are an important step in the development of a vaccine for the virus.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://evtol.com/features/pyka-autonomous-electric-stol-planes" target="_blank">For most players in the emerging urban air mobility space, UAM is synonymous with eVTOL aircraft: vehicles that can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, but with a fraction of the noise and cost. For the most part, if a vehicle can’t touch down within the space allotted to a conventional helipad, it’s not seen as a viable air taxi. Michael Norcia, the co-founder and CEO of Pyka, begs to differ and believes there’s a sweet spot between eVTOL aircraft — which achieve their vertical takeoff and landing capability at a daunting technical cost — and eCTOL airplanes, which require thousands of feet of runway to operate safely.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.theengineer.co.uk/heliogen-the-bill-gates-backed-startup-hoping-to-use-mirrors-to-power-heavy-industry" target="_blank">A breakthrough in concentrated solar power – and potentially for industrial green energy – was claimed last November from an unexpected source. A hitherto unknown company, Heliogen, announced its arrival with the revelation that it had been able to concentrate solar energy to achieve a temperature of over 1000°C, on a commercial scale, for the first time. This meant it could replace fossil fuels in critical industrial processes such as cement or steel, and potentially for thermally splitting water to produce hydrogen.</a>

These “serology tests” aren’t aimed primarily at people who currently have the disease caused by the coronavirus. Those people may have disease-fighting antibodies that give them some immunity to the new coronavirus.</a>

But soon, it might be known for its effort to fight the coronavirus. “We were approached by a couple that lives in town, long time locals who happen to own a biomedical company,” said Dr. Sharon Grundy, San Miguel County Public Health Officer. “They were gracious and offered the testing for free to our entire county which is just an unheard-of opportunity,” said Grace Franklin, Public Health Director, San Miguel County.</a>

In Telluride, Colorado, last week, one biotech company put that idea to work. United Biomedical is now working with San Miguel County to test all 8,000 residents for COVID-19 antibodies – making it the first community in the country to do widespread antibody testing.</a>

Everyone wants that — we want to get businesses and schools up and running again, and we want to get back to our normal lives.

The tests are being donated by United Biomedical, a multinational biotech company whose executives happen to live part of the year in Telluride, the resort town that is also San Miguel’s county seat.</a>

Pyka is taking on the largely human-powered spray business with an autonomous winged craft and, crucially, regulatory approval. Pyka’s approach is unlike that of many in the drone industry, which has tended to use multirotor craft for their maneuverability and easy take-off and landing.</a>

Heliogen uses solar thermal technology to produce heat intense enough to turn limestone into cement or to forge steel.</a>

There, on the outskirts of the Mojave desert, 400 giant mirrors, each the size of a large flatscreen TV, twitch in the sunlight. Their reflective faces are turned toward a nearby tower that looms over the lot like an industrial eye of Sauron. Each of these robotic heliotropes are at the beck and call of an algorithmic conductor, which directs them to focus their sunbeams toward a small target on the tower.</a>
