Commonwealth is trying to change that, and has raised more than $2 billion in venture capital from the likes of Bill Gates, Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Google, John Doerr, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and more. That’s more private capital than any other fusion startup, according to the Fusion Industry Association, the industry’s trade group.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://qz.com/hubble-telescope-needs-a-life-space-x-nasa-1850433202" target="_blank">NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, and in the decades since scientists have benefitted from its unprecedented views far beyond our galaxy. But Earth’s gravity and atmosphere will inevitably pull the bus-sized telescope back to the planet, perhaps as soon as 2028. NASA will need to safely bring it back down to crash into the Pacific Ocean, or better yet: lift it into a higher orbit so it can continue its mission, which has already cost the US about $16 billion since the idea for the telescope was conceived in 1977. Astroscale and Momentus want to use a robot to raise the telescope to a higher orbit.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-17/energy-vault-nears-finish-for-gravity-storage-project-in-china" target="_blank">California startup Energy Vault Holdings Inc. is nearing completion of its first major power-storage project, one of the only systems in the world to generate electricity using gravity. The project in Rudong, China, north of Shanghai, will be finished by September, Chief Executive Officer Robert Piconi said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. It will be able to deliver as much as 25 megawatts of power for four hours.</a>

This collab, Gizmodo notes, is a big deal given that Momentus already has a space tug craft in the works and, earlier this week, announced its water-propelled system, which a spokesperson confirmed to the online news site would be used for the proposed Hubble mission should NASA choose to select the joint project.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/how-hundreds-of-24-ton-bricks-could-fix-a-huge-renewable-energy-problem" target="_blank">Imagine a gigantic brick, packed full of tightly compressed dirt. As big as a pickup truck but about five times heavier. An elevator powered by solar panels or wind turbines hoists it over 300 feet up the side of a huge building. A trolley stows it inside and an automated system lifts and stores hundreds more bricks as the sun shines and the wind blows. Now imagine the building's control system lowering those hundreds of bricks one by one, spinning electrical power generators in the process. They drop down every evening just as demand for power peaks but solar panel output fades away.</a>

Then, there’s gravity batteries, a novel idea that you could leverage Isaac Newton’s universal force to create kinetic energy when renewables are producing at their lowest. After many years of design and small-scale trials, one the biggest companies behind this approach, Energy Vault, is almost ready for its first real-world test.</a>

By lifting the massive bricks to the facility's upper levels during periods of excess renewable energy production, the facility's cranes can store large amounts of power — and release it by subsequently lowering them back down when demand is high and the energy supply is low.</a>

As a result, some provisions specific to fission reactors, like requiring funding to cover claims from nuclear meltdowns, won’t apply to fusion plants. Fusion reactors cannot melt down.</a>

We did not have to go far, maybe 50 meters, because the prototype engine designed and built by his small engineering team is not that large. We waited for a few minutes before steam began to hiss out of the engine. And then, for a few seconds, the engine emitted a distinctive whistling sound. "There it is!" Duggleby exclaimed. By it, he meant the sound of a rotating detonation engine firing after its ignition. The sound indicated that a reaction was successfully rotating at 20,000 times a second around the engine.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90849862/axiom-space-building-commercial-space-station" target="_blank">With the International Space Station set to close by 2031, NASA has entered into commercial agreements with three companies—Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman Systems—to develop replacements, though it’s not clear they will be ready in time. Axiom Space has a head start on all of them, with the sole contract to build a commercial module that will be attached to the ISS—and eventually detach to become its own free-floating commercial station, offering a new place for humans to live and work in space long-term.</a>

The space mogul has become a billionaire several times over after his company, Intuitive Machines, wrapped up a SPAC merger. Intuitive shares skyrocketed as much as 1,200% since its debut last week, before giving back some of those gains on Thursday.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-backs-new-class-of-psychedelic-drugs-3c5b9baf" target="_blank">Wall Street is betting tens of millions of dollars on psychedelic drugs that backers say could treat mental illness for a fraction of what it costs to do therapy with better-known treatments. Transcend Therapeutics raised $40 million from venture-capital investors in January to develop a post-traumatic stress disorder treatment that its 29-year-old CEO Blake Mandell says would require about half the amount of therapy as MDMA, or ecstasy, a popular hallucinogen. Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals has announced capital raises of about $100 million since November for similar products addressing depression.</a>

The Y Combinator alumnus is developing new treatments that work similarly to psychedelics like psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms, or DMT, the hallucinogen found naturally in many animals and plants, but that have been engineered to work faster, last shorter periods of time, or lack hallucinogenic effects all together.</a>

It has also secured collaborations with high-end companies like Hermès and, most recently, the furniture maker Ligne Roset and GM Ventures, the investment arm of General Motors. If it continues to scale up, MycoWorks has enormous potential: The leather goods market is expected to surpass $720 billion by 2030.</a>

Until now. Today scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will reveal that for the first time, they have managed to achieve energy gain of greater than 1 — that is, more energy was emitted from the reactions inside their deuterium-tritium fuel capsule (2,000 megajoules) than was contained in the 192 lasers that they blasted it with.</a>

The field has drawn almost $5 billion in funding, with recent interest off the charts. One of the newest efforts to commercialize fusion comes from startup Focused Energy, founded by a pair of physics professors with expertise in extremely high-powered lasers, Todd Ditmire and Markus Roth. The startup launched last summer and has a strong bench of veterans, including Prav Patel, who spent 23 years at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-airlines-agrees-to-buy-20-boom-supersonic-jets-11660660760" target="_blank">American Airlines agreed to buy 20 planes from Boom Supersonic, betting on the future of an ultra-fast plane that is still years away. American put down a nonrefundable deposit on its initial 20 aircraft, known as the Overture, and has the option to purchase 40 more. Aerospace startup Boom is developing new planes capable of traveling at supersonic speeds, faster than the speed of sound. Overture is being designed to carry 65 to 80 passengers at Mach 1.7 over water, or 1.7 times the speed of sound—about twice as fast as commercial planes can fly today.</a>

Other airlines and leasing companies have announced their own investments in flying-taxi startups and preliminary orders. But the aircraft haven’t yet been approved by regulators to fly passengers, and customers generally haven’t had to put down cash.</a>

Workers toss microorganisms onto sawdust to grow mushroom roots into a leathery material. A few hundred yards away in a separate building, a competitor cultivates its own fungi fabric. These firms, MycoWorks and Bolt Threads, are leading a burgeoning industry to make materials that mimic the feel, durability and smell of leather, but without the animal hides. It’s taken years to get close to the real thing, but now they say their fabrics made with the whitish root of mushrooms, called mycelium, are on the cusp of breaking into a global luxury leather goods market that according to Euromonitor International will hit $78 billion this year.</a>

In an ideal world, efforts would have already been made to slow or stop the impact. The reality is that climate mitigation remains difficult, and the 40% of humanity living within 60 miles of a coast will eventually need to adapt. One option is to move inland. A less obvious option is to move offshore, onto a floating city.</a>

Venus Aerospace has been working on the hypersonic aircraft since 2020, according to a company press release, and it has raised $33 million to build the plane, of which $1 million came from government funding. Hypersonic refers to vehicles or missiles capable of traveling Mach 5 or faster, and Stargazer has the potential to reach Mach 9, or nine times the speed of sound. The vehicle is being designed to hold 12 passengers while it travels at an altitude of 170,000 feet (51.8 kilometers).</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/oneweb-founder-greg-wylers-new-startup-wants-to-launch-a-sustainable-satellite-mega-constellation" target="_blank">It’s not just military action that could exacerbate the space junk problem: Satellite mega-constellations, like those planned by SpaceX, Amazon and Telesat, could also generate more debris, if only for the reason that more objects in LEO means more opportunities for those objects to collide. Does that mean mega-constellations are incompatible with cleaning up LEO? Greg Wyler doesn’t think so. His new venture, E-Space, is aiming to reconcile the two by sending up a mesh communications satellite network composed of spacecraft that will also capture small debris before deorbiting at the end of their useful life.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/pyka-adapts-its-autonomous-electric-plane-for-cargo-runs-with-a-37m-round" target="_blank">It isn’t easy getting a new plane certified and flying — let alone an autonomous one, and electric at that. But Pyka has done just that, clearly impressing the powers that be enough to raise a $37 million A round and get to work on a new cargo-carrying variant of the Pelican aircraft. The company raised an $11 million seed round in 2019, and since then has tested and deployed several of its Pelican small aircraft, which can take off, perform complex spraying patterns and land entirely autonomously. It can be checked and operated by a single person. And the benefits of electric versus gas motors hardly need to be explained.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/different-kind-of-solar-power-attracts-attention-11650476240" target="_blank">When you think of solar energy, you probably picture the photovoltaic panels that capture sunlight to be converted to electricity. But there are other ways to harness the sun’s power. One method attracting growing interest is called concentrated solar-thermal power, or CSP, which uses mirrors to reflect and concentrate the sun’s energy. CSP has been held back by technical challenges and a shortage of funding and government incentives compared with other sources of renewable energy. But as the sense of urgency about replacing fossil fuels continues to grow, spurring demand for carbon-free energy, a number of increasingly well-funded entities are trying to improve the technology. Proponents say the heat that CSP systems produce and their storage capacity offer advantages over other renewables for generating grid-scale electricity and fueling various industrial processes.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/boom-supersonic-air-force-funding" target="_blank">Ever since the Concorde stopped soaring around at supersonic speeds in 2003, it’s been impossible for people to book a ticket on an airliner that travels faster than the speed of sound. A Colorado-based startup called Boom Supersonic—named for the sound a plane typically makes when it breaks the sound barrier—wants to change that with a yet-to-be-built passenger aircraft called Overture. Earlier today, Boom said they’d scored a new investment from the Air Force for as much as $60 million. The money will focus on “research and development on Overture,” the company said in a press release.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supersonic-commercial-air-travel-60-minutes-2021-11-21" target="_blank">The last commercial supersonic flight was almost 20 years ago, and even then super-fast flights were only on very limited routes. Most of today’s jetliners actually fly more slowly than they did 20 or 30 years ago, in order to save fuel. But that may be about to change. It’s still a long shot, but private start-up companies – with a big assist from NASA – may just give us all another chance to fly faster than the speed of sound.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/floating-city-united-nations-south-korea-2021-11" target="_blank">More than two years ago, a group of builders, engineers, and architects crowded around a table at the United Nations to discuss an ambitious concept: a floating city that could withstand natural disasters, including floods, tsunamis, and Category 5 hurricanes. The UN-backed project cleared that hurdle when the city of Busan, South Korea, agreed to host a floating city in collaboration with the project’s designer, OCEANIX, and the UN Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat). Like many coastal cities, Busan is threatened by rising sea levels.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/cognixion-raises-12m-to-build-its-brain-monitoring-headset-for-people-with-disabilities" target="_blank">Cognixion, a startup designing an intuitive brain-monitoring headset and interface for people with physical disabilities, has raised a $12M A round to pursue its accessibility ambitions. Armed with this funding, it should be able to complete the long list of requirements necessary for any medical or assistive device to be made widely available. The company makes a headset that uses electroencephalography to detect certain patterns of brain activity, which are then used to guide a cursor and navigate a full-featured interface. It uses an iPhone as its own “brain” and for a display, and connects to accessories like speakers and accessibility devices so that the user can do everything they need to in a single UI.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90685356/this-startup-is-reinventing-co2-capture-to-reduce-the-costs" target="_blank">Direct air capture—technology designed to suck CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere—could be a critical tool in fighting climate change. Climate models, including the one used by the IPCC, show decarbonizing society won’t be enough; we’ll also need huge capacity for “negative emissions” to reach climate goals. But at the moment, direct air capture is too expensive to be a valuable tool. One direct air capture startup, called CarbonCapture, wants to help bring costs down by changing a key material used in the technology.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/space-perspective-raises-40m-series-a-for-stratospheric-balloon-rides" target="_blank">Instead of going to space on a rocket, which are prohibitively expensive to develop and may not appeal to all customers, the startup plans to offer rides to the stratosphere using a capsule attached to a large balloon. Its plans have attracted investor interest: the company said it had raised a $40 million Series A to take it through to its first planned commercial flights in late 2024. Space Perspective has already collected 475 reservations, each of which was secured by a deposit between $10,000-$25,000, depending on how soon the passenger is looking to fly. The total cost of a seat is $125,000.</a>

The seed round is led by Prime Movers Lab and Alpaca VC and features a slew of additional firms, including Dolby Family Ventures, Calm Ventures, Gaingels, Towerview Ventures, GFA Venture Partners and Suffolk Construction. The startup looks to put a slew of key emerging technologies to work in service of building houses with fewer workers in a significantly truncated time frame. Diamond Age claims that when, fully realized, its tech will be able to reduce manual human labor by 55% and shrink the construction time on a single family home from nine months to 30 days. Part of this funding will go toward putting the processes in place to construct a 1,100-square-foot “demonstration house” as proof of concept.</a>

The Boom Overture is expected to fly 65 passengers from New York to London in just over three-and-one-half hours, Newark to Frankfurt in four hours and, eventually, San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours. Boom is building a 1/3 scale prototype of the aircraft and hopes to begin test flights next year. It also plans to break ground for a factory for the Overture in 2022, with planes rolling off the assembly line in 2025, followed by the first passenger flights in 2029.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/pyka-shows-off-its-new-electric-passenger-plane-the-p3" target="_blank">Pyka appeared out of nowhere in 2019 with an unusual take on electric aircraft: a pilotless crop duster. The success of this first plane led the company to begin developing its next one, the P3: a nine-passenger craft with a totally unique propeller setup aimed at making regional flights cheaper and simpler. It could be flying as soon as next year. The company also has a new president in Dan Grossman, formerly of Zipcar, Ford and Maven. The transportation sector DNA he brings could help Pyka create the networks and partnerships it needs to get off the ground in local air travel.</a>
