						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/prada-axiom-space-shoot-moon-with-new-spacesuit-2024-10-16" target="_blank">Italian luxury group Prada opens new tab and Houston-based startup Axiom Space unveiled on Wednesday the design of a spacesuit that will be used for NASA's Artemis 3 mission to the moon that is planned for 2026. In its outward appearance, the spacesuit does not stray too far from what astronauts have worn in the past. It is the familiar bulky white suit, with added red trim and grey patches on the knees and elbows. The new Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) was showcased at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan. It aims to combine highly engineered functionality and aesthetics to deal with challenging lunar conditions.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://robbreport.com/motors/aviation/richard-branson-space-perspective-balloon-flight-1235958767" target="_blank">Sir Richard Branson has signed on to be the co-pilot of Space Perspective’s first space balloon flight sometime next year, which could be the billionaire adventurer’s eighth Guinness World Record. His accolades range from earning the fastest time to cross the Atlantic in a boat to being the oldest person to ever cross the English Channel while kite-surfing. Branson also has a love of long-distance ballooning, so the Space Perspective trip should fit in his bucket list. He set a Guinness record in 1987 by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a balloon, and then in 1991 by ballooning across the Pacific, from Japan to Canada.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/uscellular-boosts-fixed-wireless-capacity-tarana-technology" target="_blank">Even though UScellular plans to sell off big chunks of its spectrum and subscribers to T-Mobile, that’s not stopping the regional wireless carrier from pursuing its fixed wireless access (FWA) ambitions — even if that means going head to head with T-Mobile in some regions. In fact, UScellular is working with Tarana Wireless to increase its FWA capacity in West Plains, Missouri, a town where the demand for FWA is high. So high that the carrier has been getting such good uptake of its fixed wireless that it was about to run out of capacity on its mobile network.</a>

The flight took place from California’s Mojave Air and Space Port and lasted about 15 minutes, seeing the XB-1 reach an altitude of 10,400 feet and a speed of 277 mph. The flight demonstrated landing gear being retracted and extended for the first time, and a new digital stability augmentation system was tested to improve handling.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91181492/how-nokia-and-axiom-are-putting-4g-on-the-moon" target="_blank">To make Artemis cheaper than Apollo, the plan is to use off-the-shelf tech, or close to it. That’s why NASA is paying Nokia to network astronauts headed for the moon. Axiom, NASA’s space suit contractor, said last week that it will use Nokia’s tech as the primary comms system for AxEMU space suits that astronauts will wear during the Artemis III landing (assuming that happens on schedule.) To fund the communications upgrade, NASA added $57.5 million to Axiom’s suit task order, which is now valued at $285.5 million.</a>

Paradromics is building a brain-computer interface, or a BCI, called the Connexus Direct Data Interface. Paradromics’ system will initially serve as an assistive communication device that can turn brain signals into outputs like text or synthesized speech. This means patients with severe paralysis could eventually use it to regain their ability to communicate. </a>

And her Houston-based company Venus Aerospace is working on a hypersonic engine that's about as close as it gets. The hypersonic engine in Venus’s Stargazer aircraft is designed to travel up to Mach 9 speeds, making it more akin to “a slow-flying rocket as opposed to a fast-flying jet” Duggleby says. The Concorde, by comparison–which still holds the record as the fastest passenger plane to cross the Atlantic–flew at Mach 2 speeds.</a>

Boom’s vision of the next supersonic airliner is a Mach 1.7 plane called the Overture, and the company just flew its first prototype. Nicknamed the “baby boom,” the XB-1 demonstrator is the “foundation” for the futuristic Overture. Boom says it uses the experimental plane to prove innovative technologies key to safe and efficient supersonic flight.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91030570/lyten-most-innovative-companies-2024" target="_blank">Graphene was invented in 2004, and Lyten is now leading efforts to use it to build cleaner, lighter, and more powerful lithium-sulfur batteries. Using a “scaffold” of 3D graphene within the electrolyte to tame the typically unruly lithium-sulfur combination, Lyten’s batteries avoid the need for nickel, manganese, cobalt, and graphite. They offer dramatic efficiency gains over their lithium-ion counterparts—not to mention environmental and ethical improvements. These will be critical for electric vehicles, drones, satellites, and other energy-intensive devices, like eVTOL aircraft.</a>

The 8-foot-long vehicle was dropped from an Aero L-29 Delfín aircraft at 12,000 feet and flew under the power of a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant engine. This engine was not fired at full thrust because the location of the test flight, an unspecified range in the United States, did not permit flight faster than the speed of sound.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkobayashisolomon/2023/12/20/energy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china" target="_blank">Energy Vault (NYSE: NRGV) will license six additional EVx gravity energy storage systems in China just months after starting the commissioning of the world’s first GESS facility near Shanghai. Energy Vault installations use excess renewable energy to lift massive composite blocks; then, when the energy is once again needed on the grid, the blocks are dropped and the kinetic energy from the dropping blocks spins generators that supply electricity to the grid. The company believes it will be able to achieve a respectable round-trip efficiency (RTE) of over 80% with its current design.</a>

Last winter, beekeepers in the US lost around half of their hives. Dalan Animal Health is focused on one challenge—a highly contagious disease called foulbrood that threatens bees worldwide. The company developed the first-ever vaccine for bees, which is given to a queen bee to pass on to her offspring. After nabbing a conditional license from the FDA in late 2022, Dalan started piloting the vaccine with thousands of hives.</a>

Commonwealth is trying to change that, and has raised more than $2 billion in venture capital from the likes of Bill Gates, Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Google, John Doerr, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and more. That’s more private capital than any other fusion startup, according to the Fusion Industry Association, the industry’s trade group.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://qz.com/hubble-telescope-needs-a-life-space-x-nasa-1850433202" target="_blank">NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, and in the decades since scientists have benefitted from its unprecedented views far beyond our galaxy. But Earth’s gravity and atmosphere will inevitably pull the bus-sized telescope back to the planet, perhaps as soon as 2028. NASA will need to safely bring it back down to crash into the Pacific Ocean, or better yet: lift it into a higher orbit so it can continue its mission, which has already cost the US about $16 billion since the idea for the telescope was conceived in 1977. Astroscale and Momentus want to use a robot to raise the telescope to a higher orbit.</a>

As big as a pickup truck but about five times heavier. An elevator powered by solar panels or wind turbines hoists it over 300 feet up the side of a huge building. A trolley stows it inside and an automated system lifts and stores hundreds more bricks as the sun shines and the wind blows. Now imagine the building's control system lowering those hundreds of bricks one by one, spinning electrical power generators in the process. They drop down every evening just as demand for power peaks but solar panel output fades away.</a>

Then, there’s gravity batteries, a novel idea that you could leverage Isaac Newton’s universal force to create kinetic energy when renewables are producing at their lowest. After many years of design and small-scale trials, one the biggest companies behind this approach, Energy Vault, is almost ready for its first real-world test.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/robust-ai-raises-20m-as-it-scales-robot-deliveries-for-pilot-customers" target="_blank">Founded in 2019, Robust.AI operates in the extremely popular — and wildly competitive — warehouse space. A number of companies formed in the wake of Amazon’s acquisition of Kiva already have large footprints in the category. The category has since grown into arguably the most competitive in all of robotics. Piggybacking on the concept that drove Rethink, human-robot interactions are at the heart of Robust’s offering.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/a-passenger-aircraft-that-flies-around-the-world-at-mach-9-sure-why-not" target="_blank">On a cloudy day in late March, Andrew Duggleby guided me a safe distance away from a rocket engine. We did not have to go far, maybe 50 meters, because the prototype engine designed and built by his small engineering team is not that large. We waited for a few minutes before steam began to hiss out of the engine. And then, for a few seconds, the engine emitted a distinctive whistling sound. "There it is!" Duggleby exclaimed. By it, he meant the sound of a rotating detonation engine firing after its ignition. The sound indicated that a reaction was successfully rotating at 20,000 times a second around the engine.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/23/archer-united-air-taxi-chicago" target="_blank">Air mobility startup Archer Aviation and United Airlines are working to bring air taxi service to Chicago. The planned service will run between O'Hare International Airport (a vital United hub) and Vertiport Chicago, a helicopter facility about three miles west of the city's South Loop. The plan is for United passengers to be able to hop aboard an Archer eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft for a 10-minute cruise to O'Hare — a trip that can take 45 minutes or longer, depending on traffic.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23651587/microsoft-climate-tech-startup-carboncapture-wyoming" target="_blank">Microsoft, an early backer of emerging technologies that take carbon dioxide emissions out of the atmosphere, has agreed to purchase carbon removal credits from Los Angeles-based startup CarbonCapture. The company has a massive facility called a direct air capture (DAC) plant in the works in Wyoming. Named Project Bison, the facility is projected to start running sometime in the latter half of 2024.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/world/new-spacesuits-science-newsletter-wt-scn" target="_blank">After more than 50 years of quiet, the moon is about to become a destination for space travelers again. The public will soon learn the names of the four astronauts who will venture on a journey around the moon next year aboard the Artemis II rocket. And when the Artemis III astronauts take things a step further by landing on the moon possibly as soon as 2025, they will need something else: the right suit.</a>
