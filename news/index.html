						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkobayashisolomon/2023/12/20/energy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china" target="_blank">Energy Vault (NYSE: NRGV) will license six additional EVx gravity energy storage systems in China just months after starting the commissioning of the world’s first GESS facility near Shanghai. Energy Vault installations use excess renewable energy to lift massive composite blocks; then, when the energy is once again needed on the grid, the blocks are dropped and the kinetic energy from the dropping blocks spins generators that supply electricity to the grid. The company believes it will be able to achieve a respectable round-trip efficiency (RTE) of over 80% with its current design.</a>

High-power microwave devices that can disrupt or even fry the electronics of aerial threats—such as drones and missiles—are moving to the forefront of defense strategies after years of development.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90978956/next-big-things-tech-food-agriculture-2023" target="_blank">Bees face multiple stresses, from climate change to pesticides. Last winter, beekeepers in the US lost around half of their hives. Dalan Animal Health is focused on one challenge—a highly contagious disease called foulbrood that threatens bees worldwide. The company developed the first-ever vaccine for bees, which is given to a queen bee to pass on to her offspring. After nabbing a conditional license from the FDA in late 2022, Dalan started piloting the vaccine with thousands of hives.</a>

That’s more private capital than any other fusion startup, according to the Fusion Industry Association, the industry’s trade group.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://qz.com/hubble-telescope-needs-a-life-space-x-nasa-1850433202" target="_blank">NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, and in the decades since scientists have benefitted from its unprecedented views far beyond our galaxy. But Earth’s gravity and atmosphere will inevitably pull the bus-sized telescope back to the planet, perhaps as soon as 2028. NASA will need to safely bring it back down to crash into the Pacific Ocean, or better yet: lift it into a higher orbit so it can continue its mission, which has already cost the US about $16 billion since the idea for the telescope was conceived in 1977. Astroscale and Momentus want to use a robot to raise the telescope to a higher orbit.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/how-hundreds-of-24-ton-bricks-could-fix-a-huge-renewable-energy-problem" target="_blank">Imagine a gigantic brick, packed full of tightly compressed dirt. As big as a pickup truck but about five times heavier. An elevator powered by solar panels or wind turbines hoists it over 300 feet up the side of a huge building. A trolley stows it inside and an automated system lifts and stores hundreds more bricks as the sun shines and the wind blows. Now imagine the building's control system lowering those hundreds of bricks one by one, spinning electrical power generators in the process. They drop down every evening just as demand for power peaks but solar panel output fades away.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a43688779/gravity-batteries-evx-energy-vault" target="_blank">Nuclear microreactors, lithium-metal batteries, and even the far-future promise of nuclear fusion are all examples of technologies that could solve this renewable energy shortcoming. Then, there’s gravity batteries, a novel idea that you could leverage Isaac Newton’s universal force to create kinetic energy when renewables are producing at their lowest. After many years of design and small-scale trials, one the biggest companies behind this approach, Energy Vault, is almost ready for its first real-world test.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/company-builds-facility-lifts-lowers-bricks-store-energy" target="_blank">Switzerland-based startup Energy Vault has broken ground on two huge facilities in Texas and just north of Shanghai to test whether we can store energy by raising and lowering hundreds of 24 metric-ton bricks made of compressed dirt. By lifting the massive bricks to the facility's upper levels during periods of excess renewable energy production, the facility's cranes can store large amounts of power — and release it by subsequently lowering them back down when demand is high and the energy supply is low.</a>

As a result, some provisions specific to fission reactors, like requiring funding to cover claims from nuclear meltdowns, won’t apply to fusion plants. Fusion reactors cannot melt down.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/a-passenger-aircraft-that-flies-around-the-world-at-mach-9-sure-why-not" target="_blank">On a cloudy day in late March, Andrew Duggleby guided me a safe distance away from a rocket engine. We did not have to go far, maybe 50 meters, because the prototype engine designed and built by his small engineering team is not that large. We waited for a few minutes before steam began to hiss out of the engine. And then, for a few seconds, the engine emitted a distinctive whistling sound. "There it is!" Duggleby exclaimed. By it, he meant the sound of a rotating detonation engine firing after its ignition. The sound indicated that a reaction was successfully rotating at 20,000 times a second around the engine.</a>

Transcend Therapeutics raised $40 million from venture-capital investors in January to develop a post-traumatic stress disorder treatment that its 29-year-old CEO Blake Mandell says would require about half the amount of therapy as MDMA, or ecstasy, a popular hallucinogen. Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals has announced capital raises of about $100 million since November for similar products addressing depression.</a>

Spartan Radar, a Southern California startup created by ex-defense industry engineers, just raised $17 million to help commercialize sensor software that it says lets even cheap radar units track their surroundings in greater detail and will improve the performance of current hands-free driving systems.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-startup-gilgamesh-pharmaceuticals-series-b-2022-12" target="_blank">Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals is trying to develop a new type of psychedelic medicine — one that has all the mental health benefits of psychedelic treatment, but without the drawbacks. The Y Combinator alumnus is developing new treatments that work similarly to psychedelics like psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms, or DMT, the hallucinogen found naturally in many animals and plants, but that have been engineered to work faster, last shorter periods of time, or lack hallucinogenic effects all together.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/business/leather-fake-mycelium-mushrooms-fashion.html" target="_blank">MycoWorks uses mycelium, the substance in the root structure of mushrooms, to make Reishi, which has the look and feel of leather and big-name companies are very interested. The company has obtained more than 75 patents and now has over 160 employees in the United States, France and Spain. It has also secured collaborations with high-end companies like Hermès and, most recently, the furniture maker Ligne Roset and GM Ventures, the investment arm of General Motors. If it continues to scale up, MycoWorks has enormous potential: The leather goods market is expected to surpass $720 billion by 2030.</a>

Until now. Today scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will reveal that for the first time, they have managed to achieve energy gain of greater than 1 — that is, more energy was emitted from the reactions inside their deuterium-tritium fuel capsule (2,000 megajoules) than was contained in the 192 lasers that they blasted it with.</a>
