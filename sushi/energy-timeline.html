				<h3>The 2020s - The Decade of Renewables</h3>
				<p>Over the course of the 2020s, renewable sources of energy will continue to plunge in price. By 2030, renewables will be the cheapest source of new electricity almost everywhere on earth, and will quite often be cheaper than the operating cost of already built coal and gas powerplants. Continued cost decreases in solar, onshore and offshore wind, and multi-hour grid energy storage will combine to make virtually all new power generation clean. Floating offshore wind will become a reality, though still small in scale and expensive. Continued reduction in the cost of batteries and advances in the energy they can store over this decade will make electric cars and trucks with long ranges cheaper than internal combustion engine vehicles. Advances in geothermal and the first commercial deployments of small modular nuclear reactors will provide humanity new clean firm energy sources. ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù steel made by a combination of electricity and green hydrogen will become a reality. And - quite possibly - nuclear fusion reactors that generate more energy than they consume will be demonstrated near the end of this decade.</p>

				<h3>The 2030s - The Acceleration</h3>
				<p>Over the course of the 2030s, renewables and intra-day energy storage will be deployed at an astounding, previously unthinkable pace. Solar in particular, powered by stunningly low costs, will grow astoundingly. Offshore wind will be the most important winter energy source, particularly in Europe, the US eastern seaboard, and the eastern seaboard of Asia. Floating offshore wind will come into its own, accessing some of the fastest, steadiest winds on earth. As these variable renewables surge, the demand for clean and ‚Äúfirm‚Äù power generation that can be dispatched at any time and thus complement wind and solar will grow. New geothermal technologies, small modular nuclear reactors, and possibly seasonal storage technologies (including hydrogen) will see more market demand than ever, and will decline in cost with scale. The incredibly low costs of batteries and of electric vehicles will lead to their almost complete dominance in new vehicle sales, and a rapid switchover of commercial fleets. To provide the raw materials for this incredible surge in renewables and batteries, new technologies will be deployed to boost the mining, recycling, and recovery of important metals such as lithium, nickel, and copper. In industrial sectors like steel and cement, green options will grow rapidly in share as they drop in cost. In the poorest parts of the world, breathtakingly cheap solar panels and batteries will bring electricity access to several hundred million people who lack it today, shrinking energy poverty massively, and improving access to food, water, and sanitation along the way. Most incredibly, the 2030s could see the first commercial deployment of nuclear fusion reactors.</p>

				<h3>The 2040s - Solving the Hardest Problems</h3>
				<p>The 2040s will be the decade where humanity addresses the hardest remaining problems in the energy system. In electricity, it will be a decade of scaling new clean firm resources, such as small modular nuclear, next generation geothermal, and potentially commercial nuclear fusion. This decade will see an enormous push to decarbonize heat production, both for building and industrial processes, through a combination of electrification and lower and lower cost hydrogen synthesis and transport. To power ‚Äúenergy islands‚Äù such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, new technologies of moving clean energy over long distances - as both molecules and electrons - will be deployed. If the cost of space launch continues to decline, space-based solar power may be deployed as a way to power specific areas. To power shipping and the rapidly growing demand for aviation, technology will enable the production of low-cost electrofuels - synthetic fuels derived from clean electricity and captured carbon.</p>

				<h3>The World in 2050 and Beyond</h3>
				<p>By 2050, humanity will have the technology it needs to halt all or virtually all carbon emissions from energy while ending energy poverty. Policy choices and the conviction of consumers, citizens, and businesses will be required in order to deploy these technologies at the speed needed. If we choose it, the tools will be there for us to use.</p>
