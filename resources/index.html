He’s hoping to be right a second time in staking his money and reputation on green energy. The pandemic, by decimating oil demand, crashing prices and challenging the economics of some fossil-fuel projects, has accelerated some industry moves toward low-carbon energy. In Mr. Gross’s view, it has also leveled the playing field for green energy’s drive to displace fossil fuels.</a>

Fred Kennedy became president of Momentus effective this week and his most recent roles were as inaugural director of the U.S. Department of Defense's Space Development Agency (SDA), and before that head of the Tactical Technology Office for DARPA. Bringing Kennedy on board could help the company get a hold of lucrative military contracts, due to the new president’s contacts, allowing Momentus a potential anchor customer to attract other clients to the fold.</a>

To keep better track of storms, NASA and startup Momentus announced a service agreement to launch a pathfinder satellite in less than a year. The agreement will see Momentus transport the TROPICS Pathfinder CubeSat to low Earth orbit no later than June 30, 2021. This mission is supposed to test out technologies and reduce risk ahead of launching the larger TROPICS constellation mission of six CubeSats, which could enter service in the next couple of years.</a>

Today, he's the founder of Unlimited Tomorrow, a company that designs low-cost, 3D printed prosthetic limbs that can be operated with the mind. It was a chance encounter in the eighth grade that set him on the path to entrepreneurship. At a science fair, he met a 7-year-old girl who had an $80,000 prosthetic arm that he described as "archaic" and offered very little help with her physical needs.</a>

It's science and—especially during a pandemic—logistics. The coronavirus crisis has led to a veritable gold rush in the biopharmaceutical industry. One company thinks it has a major advantage in that particular race: manufacturing. Covaxx, a spinout of companies within the biotech firms United Biomedical and United Neuroscience, tells Fortune that its specific technology can give it a leg up over the dozens of larger companies in the necessary aspect of delivering a vaccine to people on time.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/private-space-industrialization-is-here" target="_blank">The universal glee that surrounded the launch of the crewed Dragon spacecraft made it easy to overlook that the Falcon rocket’s red glare marked the advent of a new era — that of private space industrialization. For the first time in human history, we are not merely exploring a new landmass. We, as a biological species, are advancing to a new element — the cosmos. The whole history of humanity is the story of our struggle with space and time. Mastering new horizons, moving ever farther; driven by the desire for a better life or for profit, out of fear or out of sheer curiosity, people found ever faster, easier, cheaper and safer ways to conquer the space between here and there.</a>

Which is striking, given that he’s Russian. Crew Dragon was conceived and constructed by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s space-transport company. “It’s remarkable,” Mr. Kokorich, a physicist and aerospace engineer, says of the mission, “because it marks the transition of space exploration from the nation-state into the hands of private entrepreneurs.”</a>

The cubesat will be mated with a Momentus “transfer vehicle” that, once released from the SpaceX rocket, will take the cubesat to a sun synchronous orbit about 550 kilometers above the Earth’s surface.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/made-to-order-prosthetic-limbs" target="_blank">An estimated 40 million people across the world need a prosthetic limb. but the functionality of commercial limbs has remained stagnate -- not to mention expensive. A new prosthetic can cost anywhere between $5,000 – $50,000, according to the Jordan Thomas Foundation, and considering how growing children need upgrades every few years, the cost can easily reach past $200,000. With the introduction of its customizable "TrueLimb" prosthetic, Unlimited Tomorrow hopes to fix this problem.</a>

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants only account for 25% of total, and electrical generation is one source of GHG emissions for which cheap renewable sources are well-suited. If we don’t radically reduce the remaining 75% of emissions, we could carpet Arizona in wall-to-wall photovoltaic (PV) panels and still not do enough to bring down atmospheric CO2 levels.</a>

COVAXX is a subsidiary of United Biomedical. Dr. Steven Hinrichs, Chairman of UNMC’s Pathology and Microbiology Department, said antibody testing relies on blood samples to determine whether a person has had an immune response to COVID-19, rather than detect if the virus is present. He said the tests are an important step in the development of a vaccine for the virus.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://evtol.com/features/pyka-autonomous-electric-stol-planes" target="_blank">For most players in the emerging urban air mobility space, UAM is synonymous with eVTOL aircraft: vehicles that can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, but with a fraction of the noise and cost. For the most part, if a vehicle can’t touch down within the space allotted to a conventional helipad, it’s not seen as a viable air taxi. Michael Norcia, the co-founder and CEO of Pyka, begs to differ and believes there’s a sweet spot between eVTOL aircraft — which achieve their vertical takeoff and landing capability at a daunting technical cost — and eCTOL airplanes, which require thousands of feet of runway to operate safely.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://therising.co/2020/04/21/hvac-industry-cyclical-environmental-problem" target="_blank">When it comes to global warming, cooling systems like air conditioners and refrigerators usually don’t come to mind. But according to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) are responsible for 40% of all energy consumption in buildings. Additionally, the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that air conditioning alone used about 13% of all electricity in the world. It also produces 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. The Guardian pointed out that that’s the same amount of carbon dioxide India produces every year.</a>

A hitherto unknown company, Heliogen, announced its arrival with the revelation that it had been able to concentrate solar energy to achieve a temperature of over 1000°C, on a commercial scale, for the first time. This meant it could replace fossil fuels in critical industrial processes such as cement or steel, and potentially for thermally splitting water to produce hydrogen.</a>

These “serology tests” aren’t aimed primarily at people who currently have the disease caused by the coronavirus.

In Telluride, Colorado, last week, one biotech company put that idea to work. United Biomedical is now working with San Miguel County to test all 8,000 residents for COVID-19 antibodies – making it the first community in the country to do widespread antibody testing.</a>

Prime Movers Lab, founded by valley resident Dakin Sloss, said it has raised approximately $100 million for its first early-stage fund and backed more than a dozen “breakthrough inventors.”</a>

There, on the outskirts of the Mojave desert, 400 giant mirrors, each the size of a large flatscreen TV, twitch in the sunlight. Their reflective faces are turned toward a nearby tower that looms over the lot like an industrial eye of Sauron. Each of these robotic heliotropes are at the beck and call of an algorithmic conductor, which directs them to focus their sunbeams toward a small target on the tower.</a>

						<a class="blog-text" href="https://spacenews.com/momentus-seed-round" target="_blank">Space transportation startup Momentus raised $8.3 million in seed funding for its business to offer satellite operators rides from one orbit to another. Prime Movers Lab of Jackson, Wyoming, led the investment round for Momentus, which participated in Y Combinator, a well-known startup accelerator in Mountain View, California.</a>

						</h3>
						<a class="blog-text" href="https://mashable.com/article/cabin-cloud-sleep-bus-suspension-hotel" target="_blank">A lot of things go bump in the night, especially a bus traveling 60 mph down Interstate 5 from San Francisco to Santa Monica, California. But if Cabin, the bus-hotel startup that’s driven 10,000 passengers on overnight trips between San Francisco and SoCal since launching in July 2017, can do something about what they call “road turbulence” they think they can get more people to sleep better while traveling.</a>

But this was for science, mom, and the very nice trio that beckoned a reporter within turned out to be rather entrepreneurial spirits, who just want to create a good night’s sleep. A good night’s sleep in any context, really, but especially for the 23 passengers they hope to pack into a bus rollicking down a California freeway.</a>

The self-proclaimed “moving hotel” is an alternative to the 75-minute flight or 380-mile drive. A one-way ticket starts at $85, a budget option, especially if you factor in lodging.</a>

It was dark, with a slight breeze, and the Bayside parking lot I was searching seemed suspiciously empty. But then a ray of incandescent light — the bulb — broke through the darkness, and the two-story sleeper bus loomed before me. This coach is run and designed by Cabin, a sleeper bus startup that offered return trips from San Francisco to Los Angeles for $230, all taxes included.</a>
