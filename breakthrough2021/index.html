							<h4>George Church, PhD</h4>
							<h5>Professor of Genetics, Harvard Medical School<br>Core Faculty, Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University<br>Scientific Co-Founder of Colossal</h5>
							<p class="blog-text" style="font-size:1.5em; margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:1.5em;">George Church, PhD, a scientific co-founder of Colossal, is professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and a Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired engineering at Harvard University, Church is a recognized leader in genomics, pioneering several advances and breakthroughs that have progressed the entire field of genomics.</p>
							<p class="blog-text" style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:20px;">In 1984 with Wally Gilbert, Church developed the first direct genomic sequencing method and barcode-multiplexing tags. This led to automation and software used for the first cellular genome sequence (Helicobacter) in 1994, which evolved into ‘in-situ sequencing’ (1999) and ‘next-generation sequencing’ (2014). Church then pioneered chip-based DNA libraries, genome editing, and stem cell engineering. He also pioneered new privacy, biosafety, human engineering, environmental, biosecurity, and bioethics strategies and training. Today, he and his group champion open-access human genome data.</p>
							<p class="blog-text" style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:20px;">For his achievements and direct contributions to genomics and the sciences as a whole, Church has received numerous awards. Some of his most prestigious recognitions include National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, the Heptannual Bower Award, and Prize for Achievement in Science from the Franklin Institute.</p>
