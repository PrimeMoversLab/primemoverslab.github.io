				<h2>About AxonPrime</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 50px; font-weight: 700;">Axon Capital</p>
				<p>Founded by Dinakar Singh, Axon Capital (‚ÄúAxon‚Äù) is a global investment firm focused on concentrated long-term investments in both public and private companies. Axon manages various funds with assets under management of approximately $500 million, of which Mr. Singh and/or related and controlled entities are the largest investor.</p>
				<p>Axon was founded by Mr. Singh in 2005, after 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build, and eventually was global co-head, of the firm‚Äôs highly profitable global equities proprietary trading and investing business. For much of its early years, Axon focused on a broad range of long and short investments, based on exhaustive bottoms-up fundamental research, across asset classes and across geographies, through investment teams and offices in Asia, Europe, and the US. In addition to equities and credit long and short investments, Axon also had a significant focus on private investments, and in particular was a pioneer in large scale investing in drug royalty investments. In addition, Axon selectively engaged in high-profile activist investments in industries including healthcare and energy.</p>
				<p>In recent years, Axon has focused on making concentrated long-term investments in both public and private companies. Within private investments, the focus has been on investments in early-stage growth companies which we believe have business models that are attractive and highly scalable, and where we believe we can enhance value through our involvement. Axon often takes hands-on, leadership positions in our growth investments, and we work closely with management teams to optimize strategy and execution. All investments are based on exhaustive analysis and extensive due diligence utilizing both the Axon team, as well as an extensive network of advisors, consultants, and relationships.</p>
				<p>Axon‚Äôs leadership is comprised of Mr. Singh, and Ms. Koryn Estrada, who together serve as co-CEO and co-CIO, and have worked together for over 10 years, along with their partner Alexander Blank.</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 50px; font-weight: 700;">Prime Movers Lab</p>
				<p>Founded and led by Dakin Sloss, Prime Movers Lab LLC manages a series of venture capital funds (such venture capital funds along with Prime Movers Lab LLC, ‚ÄúPrime Movers Lab‚Äù) that make early and growth stage venture capital investments in breakthrough scientific companies. Mr. Sloss founded Prime Movers Lab in 2018 with the vision of building the world‚Äôs leading platform for investing in breakthrough scientific companies. Now, with approximately $1 billion dollars of assets under management across three funds and approximately twenty investment vehicles, Prime Movers Lab has built a leading science and deep technology investment platform comprised of a team of full-time technical partners with PhDs, experienced investment professionals and a network of expert advisors. Prime Movers Lab focuses on a broad range of industry sectors, including energy, transportation, infrastructure, human augmentation, agriculture, and manufacturing.</p>
				<p>Prime Movers Lab is a leading venture capital investor with a mission to invest in breakthrough scientific companies that Prime Movers Lab believes have the potential to impact up to billions of lives. Prime Movers Lab uses the term ‚Äòbreakthrough scientific company‚Äô to refer to companies that are developing breakthrough scientific inventions, technologies and products.</p>
				<p>Prime Movers Lab believes that a unique opportunity exists to invest in breakthrough scientific companies because the next wave of technological transformation is happening in the physical world. From dramatic advancements in human longevity and bio-medical augmentation to the next generation of supersonic air transportation and space exploration, Prime Movers Lab believes that we are at the beginning of rapid change. Despite tremendous opportunities, historically a minority of venture capital has been invested in deep technology companies. Prime Movers Lab believes most investors lack the technical and industry expertise and vision to evaluate breakthrough science and deep technology companies and their potential to scale into transformational growth businesses with leading market positions.</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 50px; font-weight: 700;">AxonPrime</p>
				<p>AxonPrime will benefit from Prime Movers Lab‚Äôs leading science and deep technology investment platform. Prime Movers Lab has a team of full-time technical partners with PhDs and advanced degrees in aerospace engineering, chemical and biomolecular engineering, cell and structural biology, electrical engineering, and robotics and industrial and operations engineering, among others. These technical partners help formulate investment theses, source investment opportunities and evaluate both science and engineering risk associated with potential investments. Prime Movers Lab also has a network of approximately 50 leading expert advisors in key areas such as space, longevity, neuroscience, microbiome and advanced materials. These advisors bring decades of industry specific, deep science and technical expertise to Prime Movers Lab on a project-by-project basis.</p>
