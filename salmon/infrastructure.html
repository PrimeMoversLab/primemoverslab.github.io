				<h4>We believe companies focused on scientific and technological innovation in the areas of communication, robotics, building and construction technology, water, 3D printing and semiconductors will lead that transformation and generate tremendous value for their shareholders. Past innovation has rapidly increased the rate of development and decreased the cost of foundational technologies in communications, data processing, computing power and robotics that are enabling transformational opportunities. We expect that innovation in these areas will continue to accelerate. Prime Movers Lab has utilized its leading science and deep technology investing platform to identify, evaluate and invest in leading companies in these areas, including Diamond Age Corp., Fort Robotics, Inc., Halo Industries, Inc., and Tarana Wireless, Inc.</h4>
