							<h4>Why Fusion?</h4>
							<p>In this series we are exploring fusion because it can massively alter the energy landscape of the future. Fusion is incredibly attractive as an energy source because:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>It can be built anywhere in the world (no pipelines, wind, or sunshine needed)</li>
								<li>Fusion can support an almost infinite increase in energy demand because the fuel is essentially unlimited. This includes increasingly dense population centers</li>
								<li>The supply chain can be entirely located within a country for energy independence and reduced price volatility</li>
								<li>Fusion provides baseload power, complementing intermittent energy sources like wind and solar</li>
								<li>Fusion power is clean — no waste or pollution is produced</li>
							</ul>
							<img src="img/fusion1.png">
							<p>While nuclear fission (what we refer to as nuclear power today) is a carbon-free source of baseload power that is well established, there are several reasons that fusion would be even better. The fuel used by nuclear fission plants, Uranium-235, can be enriched to make bombs, leading to nuclear weapons proliferation concerns. Nuclear plants also generate some radioactive waste [1], and there is the low probability of an accident leading to release. (Although as someone who has worked in nuclear power plants, I would happily live next to one.) Currently, the most significant barrier to building new conventional nuclear (fission) plants in the US is economic — the cost per kW of new capacity added simply isn’t competitive with other forms of energy generation. [2]</p>
							<p>Nuclear fusion is essentially the opposite of nuclear fission, which powers nuclear plants today. In nuclear fission, a single large atom, usually Uranium-235, breaks into two smaller atoms and releases energy. In nuclear fusion, energy is produced when two atoms are smashed together to become one larger atom. This process is what powers the sun, and has produced all the heavier elements in the universe. [3] On earth, the atoms used for fusion are usually isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest element on the periodic table. [4]</p>
							<img src="img/fusion2.png">
							<p>The question isn’t “is fusion possible”. The hydrogen bombs that were tested in the 1950s (now in the arsenal of most of the world’s nuclear powers) are called hydrogen bombs because most of their energy comes from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes. Their precursor, the atomic bomb deployed by the US in WWII, instead produces energy from nuclear fission of enriched uranium or plutonium. In a hydrogen bomb, fusion is triggered by a mini-atomic bomb (fission of uranium or plutonium), releasing incredible amounts of energy. While the hydrogen bomb program demonstrated that fusion can occur with sufficient energy input, it’s worth noting that it relies on enriched uranium or plutonium to work — fusion alone has not been weaponized.</p>
							<p>Since then, we have found ways to achieve fusion other than by detonating atomic bombs. The challenge is providing enough energy to overcome the repulsive forces between atoms. Once this energy barrier is exceeded, the two atoms fuse together- the new atom weighs a tiny bit less, and that extra mass is converted into lots of energy. This is an example of Einstein’s famous equation, E (energy) = m (mass) x c (speed of light)². Unfortunately the repulsive forces between atoms are so strong that the fuel (e.g. hydrogen) must be brought to millions of degrees C without melting the container or letting it cool off.</p>
							<p>One strategy is to use powerful magnets. At these temperatures, gases become plasmas, which conduct electricity. Because of how magnetic fields and electric fields interact, magnets can be used to keep the high temperature plasma away from the walls while the fusion reaction takes place. This approach is called <b>magnetic confinement fusion (MCF)</b>, and the machine that results looks like a giant robot donut.</p>
							<img src="img/fusion3.jpeg">
							<p class="small-caption"><small>Inside the Joint European Torus, one of the largest magnetic confinement fusion research facilities.</small></p>
							<p>The second major non-bomb strategy uses lasers and is called <b>inertial confinement fusion (ICF)</b>. A small amount of fuel is released into a chamber and then zapped with powerful lasers that quickly heat and compress the fuel before it can fly apart. We will talk more about inertial confinement fusion technology in the next post, but for now remember that there are two main routes to fusion power: magnets and lasers.</p>
							<h5 class="pullquote">Instances of fusion of light atoms have been observed in research facilities all around the world. However, it has always required more energy to make the fusion happen than is released when the atoms come together.</h5>
							<p>For fusion power to go from dream to reality, two things must happen. First, ignition, or net energy gain, must be achieved — this is the holy grail of all fusion programs. However, to really change the world, fusion companies must also show a credible path to power plants that are not only safe and reliable, but also make economic sense. More on both topics to come in this series.</p>

							<h4>Why Now?</h4>
							<p>Looking back at past promises and news articles, it is easy to understand the joke — “fusion is always 20 years away”. The process of getting two atoms close enough together to fuse is incredibly complex and difficult to model. Then it takes a ton of energy and complex equipment to test if the model is right. For many years, the money required (and in some cases weapons implications) meant that research fusion was run by government research efforts and was often classified.</p>
							<p>Fusion research was slowly declassified and merged with civilian and academic plasma physics research, but fusion projects were still by necessity “Big Science”. The mainstream coverage of fusion that most of us remember (circa 2000s) involves ITER, an enormous international MCF (magnet fusion) project under construction in France that began back in 2007 and recently reached the half-way mark in construction. Much will and has been learned from ITER about materials, design, diagnostics, and plasma physics (not the least training thousands of scientists and technical tradespeople), but it is envisioned and structured as a research project, not a business.</p>
							<p>In the past ten years, several companies have been created to commercialize new fusion concepts and the advances made in research. Startups such as Commonwealth Fusion are demonstrating that magnetic confinement fusion might be possible on a smaller scale and development timeframe than ITER. Importantly, they are leveraging development of superconducting magnet technology (which has applications beyond fusion) to make a business case.</p>
