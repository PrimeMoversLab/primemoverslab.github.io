				<p id="description"><i>Prime Movers Lab</i> invests in physics-powered startups founded by <i>Prime Movers</i>, the achievers who serve as engines for human progress and prosperity.

Our team has developed in-depth academic scientific research, commercialized novel physics intellectual property, scaled significant enterprises, and mentored renowned scientists on their entrepreneurial journey.</p>
				<p id="quote">“Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed. The great creators—the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors—stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.”</p>
				<p>—The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand</p>
				<p id="description">If you are a <i>Prime Mover</i> with a growth mentality and breakthrough inventions in physics, we want to learn about and help you to realize your ambitious plans to revolutionize the most important industries in the world. <a href="mailto:dakin@primemoverslab.com">Contact us</a></p>
